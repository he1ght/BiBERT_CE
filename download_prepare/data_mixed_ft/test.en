you know , one of the intense pleasure ##s of travel and one of the del ##ight ##s of ethn ##ograph ##ic research is the opportunity to live among ##st those who have not forg ##otten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stone ##s pol ##ished by rain , taste it in the bitte ##r leaves of plants .
just to know that jag ##ua ##r sh ##ama ##ns still journey beyond the milk ##y way , or the myth ##s of the in ##uit elder ##s still reson ##ate with meaning , or that in the him ##ala ##ya , the buddh ##ists still purs ##ue the breath of the dh ##arm ##a , is to really remember the central reve ##la ##t ##ion of anthrop ##ology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adapt ##ive choices that our line ##age made , alb ##eit successful ##ly , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adapt ##ive imper ##atives .
we ' re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi ##ation rit ##es .
we have to deal with the ine ##x ##ora ##ble separ ##ation of death , so it shouldn ' t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what ' s interesting is the unique ca ##den ##ce of the song , the rhyth ##m of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the pen ##an in the forest ##s of born ##e ##o , or the vo ##od ##oo ac ##ol ##y ##tes in haiti , or the war ##ri ##ors in the ka ##is ##ut desert of northern kenya , the cur ##ander ##o in the mountains of the and ##es , or a car ##av ##ans ##era ##i in the middle of the sahara - - this is inc ##ident ##ally the fellow that i travel ##ed into the desert with a month ago - - or indeed a y ##ak her ##der in the sl ##opes of q ##om ##ola ##ng ##ma , everest , the god ##des ##s mother of the world .
all of these people ##s teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orient ##ing yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my ##ria ##d cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that en ##velop ##s the planet , and is as important to the well - being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio ##sp ##here .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethn ##osphere , and you might define the ethn ##osphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myth ##s , ideas , inspiration ##s , intuition ##s brought into being by the human imagination since the da ##wn of consciousness .
the ethn ##osphere is humanity ' s great leg ##acy .
it ' s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishing ##ly in ##qu ##is ##itive species .
and just as the bio ##sp ##here has been severe ##ly ero ##ded , so too is the ethn ##osphere - - and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biolog ##ists , for example , would dar ##e suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br ##ink of extinct ##ion because it simply is not true , and yet that - - the most ap ##oc ##aly ##pt ##ic scen ##ario in the real ##m of biological diversity - - scar ##cel ##y approach ##es what we know to be the most optimistic scen ##ario in the real ##m of cultural diversity .
and the great indic ##ator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6 , 000 languages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of voc ##ab ##ular ##y or a set of gramm ##atic ##al rules .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
it ' s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an old - growth forest of the mind , a water ##sh ##ed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6 , 000 languages , as we sit here today in mont ##ere ##y , fully half are no longer being wh ##is ##per ##ed into the ears of children .
they ' re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they ' re already dead .
what could be more lon ##el ##y than to be en ##velop ##ed in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anti ##ci ##pa ##te the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre ##ad ##ful fat ##e is indeed the pl ##ight of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and car ##ries with him into the grav ##e the last sy ##ll ##ables of an ancient ton ##gu ##e .
and i know there ' s some of you who say , " well , wouldn ' t it be better , wouldn ' t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? " and i say , " great , let ' s make that language y ##or ##ub ##a . let ' s make it can ##ton ##ese .
let ' s make it ko ##g ##i . "
and you ' ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un ##able to speak your own language .
and so , what i ' d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethn ##osphere , a brief journey through the ethn ##osphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say " different ways of being , " i really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a bar ##asa ##na in the north ##west amazon , the people of the an ##ac ##ond ##a who believe that myth ##ological ##ly they came up the milk river from the east in the bell ##y of sac ##red sn ##akes .
now , this is a people who cognitive ##ly do not dist ##ingu ##ish the color blue from the color green because the can ##opy of the heaven ##s is equ ##ated to the can ##opy of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called " lin ##gu ##istic ex ##og ##am ##y : " you must mar ##ry someone who speak ##s a different language .
and this is all root ##ed in the myth ##ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of inter ##mar ##ria ##ge , you never hear anyone pract ##icing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating trib ##es i ever lived with , the wa ##ora ##n ##i of north ##e ##aster ##n ec ##ua ##do ##r , an astonishing people first contact ##ed peace ##fully in 195 ##8 .
in 195 ##7 , five mission ##aries attempt ##ed contact and made a critical mistake .
they dropped from the air 8 x 10 glo ##ss ##y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gest ##ures , forget ##ting that these people of the rain ##fore ##st had never seen anything two - dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concl ##ude ##d that these were calling cards from the dev ##il , so they spe ##ared the five mission ##aries to death .
but the wa ##ora ##n ##i didn ' t just spe ##ar outside ##r ##s .
they spe ##ared each other .
5 ##4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe ##ari ##ng each other .
we tra ##ced gene ##alog ##ies back eight generations , and we found two instance ##s of natural death and when we pressure ##d the people a little bit about it , they admit ##ted that one of the fellow ##s had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe ##ared him anyway .
but at the same time they had a pers ##p ##ica ##cious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
their hun ##ters could smell animal ur ##ine at 40 pac ##es and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early ' 80 ##s , i had a really astonishing assign ##ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , inf ##ilt ##rat ##ing the secret societies which were the foundation of du ##val ##ier ' s strength and ton ##ton mac ##out ##es , and sec ##uring the po ##ison used to make zo ##m ##bie ##s .
in order to make sense out of sens ##ation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo ##do ##un . and vo ##od ##oo is not a black magic cult .
on the contra ##ry , it ' s a complex metaph ##ys ##ical world ##v ##iew .
it ' s interesting .
if i asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
christ ##ian ##ity , islam , buddh ##ism , jud ##ai ##s ##m , whatever .
there ' s always one continent left out , the assum ##ption being that sub - sahara ##n africa had no religious belief ##s . well , of course , they did and vo ##od ##oo is simply the dist ##illa ##t ##ion of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the trag ##ic di ##as ##por ##a of the sla ##ver ##y era .
but , what makes vo ##od ##oo so interesting is that it ' s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spirit ##s .
the spirit ##s can be inv ##oke ##d from bene ##ath the great water , respond ##ing to the rhyth ##m of the dance to moment ##arily displ ##ace the soul of the living , so that for that brief sh ##ining moment , the ac ##ol ##y ##te becomes the god .
that ' s why the vo ##od ##oo ##ists like to say that " you white people go to church and speak about god .
we dance in the tem ##ple and become god . "
and because you are poss ##essed , you are taken by the spirit - - how can you be harm ##ed ?
so you see these astonishing demonstration ##s : vo ##od ##oo ac ##ol ##y ##tes in a state of tra ##n ##ce hand ##ling burning em ##bers with imp ##un ##ity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bear ##s it when cat ##aly ##zed in the state of extreme exc ##itation .
now , of all the people ##s that i ' ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the ko ##g ##i of the sie ##r ##ra ne ##va ##da de san ##t ##a mart ##a in northern col ##om ##bi ##a .
desc ##end ##ants of the ancient ta ##ir ##ona civilization which once car ##pet ##ed the car ##ib ##be ##an coast ##al pl ##ain of col ##om ##bi ##a , in the wake of the con ##ques ##t , these people ret ##reat ##ed into an isol ##ated vol ##can ##ic mass ##if that so ##ars above the car ##ib ##be ##an coast ##al pl ##ain .
in a blood ##sta ##ined continent , these people alone were never con ##que ##red by the span ##ish .
to this day , they remain rule ##d by a ritual pr ##iest ##hood but the training for the pr ##iest ##hood is rather extraordinary .
the young ac ##ol ##y ##tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , se ##ques ##ter ##ed in a shad ##ow ##y world of dark ##ness in stone hut ##s at the base of gl ##ac ##iers for 18 years : two nine - year period ##s del ##iber ##ately chose ##n to mim ##ic the nine months of gest ##ation they spend in their natural mother ' s wom ##b ; now they are metaphor ##ically in the wom ##b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are inc ##ultur ##ated into the values of their society , values that maint ##ain the prop ##osition that their pra ##yers and their pra ##yers alone maint ##ain the cosm ##ic - - or we might say the ec ##ological - - balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi ##ation , one day they ' re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun ##ris ##e . and in that cry ##sta ##l moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bath ##e the sl ##opes of the stun ##ning ##ly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is aff ##irm ##ed in stun ##ning glo ##ry . and the pr ##iest steps back and says , " you see ? it ' s really as i ' ve told you .
it is that beautiful . it is your ##s to protect . "
they call themselves the " elder brothers " and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroy ##ing the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of ind ##igen ##ous people and landscape , we either inv ##oke rou ##ss ##e ##au and the old can ##ard of the " no ##ble sav ##age , " which is an idea ra ##ci ##st in its simplicity , or alternative ##ly , we inv ##oke th ##ore ##au and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
well , ind ##igen ##ous people are neither sent ##iment ##al nor weak ##ene ##d by no ##sta ##l ##g ##ia .
there ' s not a lot of room for either in the malaria ##l sw ##amp ##s of the as ##mat or in the ch ##illing wind ##s of tib ##et , but they have , never ##the ##less , through time and ritual , forg ##ed a traditional my ##st ##i ##que of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self - conscious ##ly close to it , but on a far subt ##ler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is breathe ##d into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the and ##es who ' s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap ##u spirit that will direct his or her dest ##in ##y will be a profound ##ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mont ##ana raised to believe that a mountain is a pil ##e of rock ready to be mine ##d .
whether it ' s the ab ##ode of a spirit or a pil ##e of or ##e is irre ##le ##vant .
what ' s interesting is the metaphor that define ##s the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
i was raised in the forest ##s of british columb ##ia to believe those forest ##s existed to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends among ##st the k ##wa ##g ##i ##ult ##h who believe that those forest ##s were the ab ##ode of hu ##x ##wh ##uk ##w and the cro ##oke ##d be ##ak of heaven and the cann ##ib ##al spirit ##s that d ##well ##ed at the north end of the world , spirit ##s they would have to engage during their ham ##ats ##a initi ##ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different real ##ities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discover ##ies . take this plant here .
it ' s a photograph i took in the north ##west amazon just last april .
this is a ##ya ##h ##ua ##sc ##a , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psych ##o ##act ##ive prepar ##ation of the sh ##ama ##n ' s repe ##rt ##o ##ire .
what makes a ##ya ##h ##ua ##sc ##a fascinating is not the she ##er pharm ##ac ##ological potential of this prepar ##ation , but the el ##abor ##ation of it . it ' s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this wood ##y li ##ana which has in it a series of bet ##a - car ##bol ##ines , harm ##ine , harm ##al ##ine , mil ##d ##ly hallu ##cin ##ogen ##ic - - to take the vi ##ne alone is rather to have sort of blue ha ##zy smoke dr ##ift across your consciousness - - but it ' s mix ##ed with the leaves of a shr ##ub in the coffee family called psych ##ot ##ria vir ##id ##is .
this plant had in it some very powerful try ##pt ##amine ##s , very close to brain ser ##oto ##n ##in , di ##met ##hy ##lt ##ry ##pt ##amine , 5 - metho ##x ##y ##di ##met ##hy ##lt ##ry ##pt ##amine .
if you ' ve ever seen the y ##an ##om ##ami blow ##ing that sn ##uf ##f up their nose ##s , that subst ##ance they make from a different set of species also contain ##s metho ##x ##y ##di ##met ##hy ##lt ##ry ##pt ##amine .
to have that pow ##der blow ##n up your nose is rather like being shot out of a r ##if ##le barr ##el line ##d with bar ##o ##que paintings and land ##ing on a sea of electricity .
it doesn ' t create the dist ##ort ##ion of reality ; it creates the diss ##olution of reality .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard ev ##an sh ##ult ##es - - who is a man who sp ##ark ##ed the psych ##ed ##el ##ic era with his discovery of the magic mush ##rooms in mexico in the 193 ##0s - - i used to argue that you couldn ' t class ##ify these try ##pt ##amine ##s as hallu ##cin ##ogen ##ic because by the time you ' re under the effects there ' s no one home anymore to experience a hallu ##cin ##ation .
but the thing about try ##pt ##amine ##s is they cannot be taken or ##ally because they ' re den ##ature ##d by an enzy ##me found naturally in the human gut called mon ##o ##amine ox ##ida ##se .
they can only be taken or ##ally if taken in con ##j ##un ##ction with some other chemical that den ##atures the ma ##o .
now , the fascinating things are that the bet ##a - car ##bol ##ines found within that li ##ana are ma ##o in ##hib ##itors of the precise sort necessary to poten ##t ##iate the try ##pt ##amine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a flor ##a of 80 , 000 species of v ##as ##cul ##ar plants , do these people find these two mor ##ph ##ological ##ly unre ##la ##ted plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of bio ##chem ##ical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu ##ph ##em ##ism , " trial and error , " which is exp ##osed to be meaning ##less .
but you ask the indian ##s , and they say , " the plants talk to us . "
well , what does that mean ?
this trib ##e , the co ##f ##an , has 17 vari ##et ##ies of a ##ya ##h ##ua ##sc ##a , all of which they dist ##ingu ##ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer ##able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they establ ##ish their tax ##onom ##y and they say , " i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don ' t you know anything ? " and i said , " no . "
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 vari ##et ##ies in the night of a full moon , and it sing ##s to you in a different key .
now , that ' s not going to get you a ph . d . at harvard , but it ' s a lot more interesting than count ##ing stam ##ens .
now - - - - the problem - - the problem is that even those of us sym ##pa ##the ##t ##ic with the pl ##ight of ind ##igen ##ous people view them as qu ##ain ##t and color ##ful but somehow reduce ##d to the mar ##gin ##s of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remember ##ed for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either active ##ly end ##ors ##ed or pass ##ively accept ##ed the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn ' t change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the s ##io ##u ##x indian ##s did not stop being s ##io ##u ##x when they gave up the bow and arr ##ow any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bug ##g ##y .
it ' s not change or technology that threaten ##s the integr ##ity of the ethn ##osphere . it is power , the cru ##de face of domin ##ation .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures dest ##ined to fa ##de away ; these are dynamic living people ##s being driven out of existence by identif ##iable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it ' s the eg ##reg ##ious def ##orest ##ation in the home ##land of the pen ##an - - a nom ##ad ##ic people from south ##e ##ast asia , from sar ##aw ##ak - - a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduce ##d to serv ##itude and prost ##itution on the bank ##s of the river ##s , where you can see the river itself is soil ##ed with the sil ##t that seems to be carrying half of born ##e ##o away to the south china sea , where the japanese frei ##ght ##ers hang light in the horiz ##on ready to fill their hold ##s with raw log ##s r ##ipped from the forest - - or , in the case of the y ##an ##om ##ami , it ' s the disease ent ##ities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of tib ##et , where i ' m doing a lot of research recently , you ' ll see it ' s a cru ##de face of political domin ##ation .
you know , gen ##oc ##ide , the physical extinct ##ion of a people is universal ##ly cond ##em ##ne ##d , but ethn ##oc ##ide , the destruction of people ' s way of life , is not only not cond ##em ##ne ##d , it ' s universal ##ly , in many quarter ##s , celebrate ##d as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of tib ##et until you move through it at the ground level .
i once travel ##led 6 , 000 miles from che ##ng ##du in western china over ##land through south ##e ##aster ##n tib ##et to l ##ha ##sa with a young colleag ##ue , and it was only when i got to l ##ha ##sa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6 , 000 sac ##red mon ##uments tor ##n apart to dust and as ##hes , 1 . 2 million people killed by the ca ##dr ##es during the cultural revolution .
this young man ' s father had been as ##c ##rib ##ed to the pan ##chen lam ##a .
that meant he was inst ##antly killed at the time of the chinese inv ##asion .
his unc ##le fle ##d with his hol ##iness in the di ##as ##por ##a that took the people to ne ##pa ##l .
his mother was inc ##ar ##cer ##ated for the crime of being wealth ##y .
he was sm ##ug ##gle ##d into the ja ##il at the age of two to hide bene ##ath her ski ##rt tail ##s because she couldn ' t bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that bra ##ve dee ##d was put into an education camp .
one day she in ##ad ##vert ##ently step ##ped on an arm ##band of ma ##o , and for that trans ##gress ##ion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of tib ##et can be impossible to bear , but the rede ##mp ##t ##ive spirit of the people is something to beh ##old .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon ##och ##rom ##atic world of mon ##oto ##ny or do we want to embrace a poly ##ch ##rom ##atic world of diversity ?
mar ##gar ##et me ##ad , the great anthrop ##ologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dr ##ift ##ed towards this bl ##and ##ly am ##or ##ph ##ous gener ##ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduce ##d to a more nar ##row mod ##ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forg ##otten there were even other possibilities .
and it ' s hum ##bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for [ 150 , 000 ] years .
the ne ##ol ##ith ##ic revolution - - which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc ##c ##umb ##ed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the sh ##ama ##n was displ ##aced by the pros ##e of the pr ##iest ##hood ; we created hierarch ##y special ##ization sur ##pl ##us - - is only 10 , 000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bare ##ly 300 years old .
now , that shall ##ow history doesn ' t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will conf ##ron ##t us in the ens ##uing millenn ##ia .
when these my ##ria ##d cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10 , 000 different voices .
and it ' s within that song that we will all red ##is ##cover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ens ##uring that all people ##s and all garden ##s find a way to flo ##ur ##ish . and there are great moments of optim ##ism .
this is a photograph i took at the northern t ##ip of ba ##ffin island when i went nar ##wh ##al hun ##ting with some in ##uit people , and this man , ol ##ay ##uk , told me a mar ##vel ##ous story of his grandfather .
the can ##ad ##ian government has not always been kind to the in ##uit people , and during the 1950 ##s , to establ ##ish our sov ##erei ##gn ##ty , we forced them into sett ##lement ##s .
this old man ' s grandfather ref ##used to go .
the family , fear ##ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the in ##uit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run ##ners of their sle ##ds were original ##ly made of fish wra ##pped in car ##ib ##ou hide .
so , this man ' s grandfather was not intim ##ida ##ted by the ar ##ctic night or the bl ##izz ##ard that was blow ##ing .
he simply sl ##ipped outside , pulled down his sea ##ls ##ki ##n trou ##ser ##s and defe ##ca ##ted into his hand . and as the fe ##ces began to free ##ze , he shaped it into the form of a bl ##ade .
he put a spr ##ay of sal ##iv ##a on the edge of the sh ##it kn ##ife and as it finally fro ##ze solid , he but ##cher ##ed a dog with it .
he skin ##ne ##d the dog and improv ##ised a har ##ness , took the r ##ib ##ca ##ge of the dog and improv ##ised a sle ##d , har ##ness ##ed up an adj ##ace ##nt dog , and disappear ##ed over the ice flo ##es , sh ##it kn ##ife in bel ##t .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways - - - - is a symbol of the resil ##ience of the in ##uit people and of all ind ##igen ##ous people around the world .
the can ##ad ##ian government in april of 199 ##9 gave back to total control of the in ##uit an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
it ' s our new home ##land . it ' s called nun ##av ##ut .
it ' s an independent terr ##itor ##y . they control all miner ##al resources .
an amazing example of how a nation - state can see ##k rest ##itution with its people .
and finally , in the end , i think it ' s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who ' ve travel ##ed in these remote reach ##es of the planet , to realize that they ' re not remote at all .
they ' re home ##lands of somebody .
they represent bran ##ches of the human imagination that go back to the da ##wn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na ##ked geograph ##y of hope .
so , what we ' re trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accompl ##ish anything .
we think that pole ##mi ##c ##s - - - - we think that pole ##mi ##c ##s are not persu ##as ##ive , but we think that storyte ##lling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storyte ##lling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
15 ##6 nations carry our television channel .
our magazine ##s are read by millions .
and what we ' re doing is a series of journey ##s to the ethn ##osphere where we ' re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da ##zz ##led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradu ##ally , one by one , the central reve ##la ##t ##ion of anthrop ##ology : that this world deser ##ves to exist in a divers ##e way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multi ##cul ##t ##ural , pl ##ural ##istic world where all of the wisdom of all people ##s can contrib ##ute to our collective well - being .
thank you very much .
what i ' m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foundation ##al work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acqu ##is ##ition almost exactly a year ago . this is sea ##dr ##agon , and it ' s an environment in which you can either local ##ly or remote ##ly interact with vast amounts of visual data .
we ' re looking at many , many gig ##ab ##y ##tes of digital photos here and kind of sea ##m ##less ##ly and continu ##ously zoom ##ing in , pan ##ning through the thing , re ##arr ##ang ##ing it in any way we want .
and it doesn ' t matter how much information we ' re looking at , how big these collection ##s are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of congress , and it ' s in the 300 mega ##p ##ix ##el range .
it doesn ' t make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of p ##ix ##els on your screen at any given moment . it ' s also very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non - image data .
this is " ble ##ak house " by dick ##ens . every colum ##n is a chapter .
to prove to you that it ' s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real represent ##ation of the text ; it ' s not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e - book .
i wouldn ' t rec ##ommen ##d it .
this is a more real ##istic case . this is an issue of the guard ##ian .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inher ##ently multi - scale kind of medium .
we ' ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guard ##ian .
we ' ve made up a fake ad that ' s very high resolution - - much higher than you ' d be able to get in an ordinary ad - - and we ' ve embedded extra content .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specific ##ations .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real est ##ate .
we hope that this means no more pop - up ##s and other kind of rub ##bi ##sh like that - - shouldn ' t be necessary .
of course , map ##ping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and this one i really won ' t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contrib ##ute to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the u . s .
super ##imp ##osed on top of a nasa ge ##osp ##ati ##al image .
so let ' s pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called photos ##ynth , which really marri ##es two different technologies .
one of them is sea ##dr ##agon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no ##ah sn ##av ##el ##y , a graduate student at the university of washington , co - adv ##ised by steve seit ##z at u . w .
and r ##ick s ##zel ##is ##ki at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the web . it ' s powered by sea ##dr ##agon .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of view ##s , where we can div ##e through images and have this kind of multi - resolution experience .
but the sp ##ati ##al arrang ##ement of the images here is actually meaningful .
the computer vision algorithms have reg ##ister ##ed these images together so that they corresp ##ond to the real space in which these shot ##s - - all taken near grass ##i lake ##s in the can ##ad ##ian rock ##ies - - all these shot ##s were taken . so you see elements here of stabil ##ized slide - show or pan ##ora ##mi ##c imag ##ing , and these things have all been related sp ##ati ##ally .
i ' m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more sp ##ati ##al .
i would like to jump straight to one of no ##ah ' s original data - sets - - and this is from an early prototyp ##e of photos ##ynth that we first got working in the summer - - to show you what i think is really the pun ##ch line behind this technology , the photos ##ynth technology . and it ' s not necessarily so appar ##ent from looking at the environments that we ' ve put up on the website .
we had to worry about the law ##yers and so on .
this is a recon ##stru ##ction of not ##re dame cath ##ed ##ral that was done entirely comput ##ational ##ly from images sc ##ra ##ped from flick ##r . you just type not ##re dame into flick ##r , and you get some pictures of guys in t - shirt ##s , and of the camp ##us and so on . and each of these orange con ##es represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
and so these are all flick ##r images , and they ' ve all been related sp ##ati ##ally in this way .
and we can just navig ##ate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought that i ' d end up working at microsoft .
it ' s very grat ##ifying to have this kind of rece ##ption here .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it ' s everything from cell phone cameras to professional sl ##r ##s , quite a large number of them , st ##itch ##ed together in this environment .
and if i can , i ' ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are occ ##lu ##ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs - - here we go .
this is actually a poster of not ##re dame that reg ##ister ##ed correct ##ly .
we can div ##e in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody - - from the entire collective memory of , visual ##ly , of what the earth looks like - - and link all of that together .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emer ##gen ##t that ' s greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emer ##ges of the entire earth .
think of this as the long tail to stephen law ##ler ' s virtual earth work .
and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting tag ##ged with met ##a - data that somebody else enter ##ed .
if somebody both ##ered to tag all of these sa ##ints and say who they all are , then my photo of not ##re dame cath ##ed ##ral suddenly gets en ##ric ##he ##d with all of that data , and i can use it as an ent ##ry point to div ##e into that space , into that met ##a - vers ##e , using everybody else ' s photos , and do a kind of a cross - mod ##al and cross - user social experience that way .
and of course , a by - product of all of that is immen ##sel ##y rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , collected not just from over ##head flight ##s and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
yes . what this is really doing is discover ##ing .
it ' s creating hyper ##lin ##ks , if you will , between images .
and it ' s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich ##ness of the se ##man ##t ##ic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phrase ##s , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of se ##man ##t ##ic inter ##conne ##ction and the amount of rich ##ness that comes out of that is really huge . it ' s a classic network effect .
bl ##ai ##se , that is truly incredible . con ##gra ##t ##ulation ##s .
thanks so much .
i ' m going to talk to you about some stuff that ' s in this book of mine that i hope will reson ##ate with other things you ' ve already heard , and i ' ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
i want to start with what i call the " official dog ##ma . "
the official dog ##ma of what ?
the official dog ##ma of all western industrial societies .
and the official dog ##ma runs like this : if we are interested in maxim ##izing the wel ##far ##e of our citizens , the way to do that is to maxim ##ize individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , worth ##wh ##ile , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim ##ize our wel ##far ##e , and no one has to decide on our beha ##l ##f .
the way to maxim ##ize freedom is to maxim ##ize choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel ##far ##e they have .
this , i think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn ' t occur to anyone to question it .
and it ' s also deeply embedded in our lives .
i ' ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my super ##mark ##et . not such a big one .
i want to say just a word about sal ##ad dress ##ing .
17 ##5 sal ##ad dress ##ings in my super ##mark ##et , if you don ' t count the 10 extra - virgin ol ##ive oil ##s and 12 bal ##sam ##ic vi ##ne ##gar ##s you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal ##ad dress ##ings , in the off - chance that none of the 17 ##5 the store has on offer suit you .
so this is what the super ##mark ##et is like .
and then you go to the consumer electronic ##s store to set up a stere ##o system - - speak ##ers , c ##d player , tape player , tun ##er , amp ##li ##f ##ier - - and in this one single consumer electronic ##s store , there are that many stere ##o systems .
we can constru ##ct six - and - a - half - million different stere ##o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you ' ve got to admit that ' s a lot of choice .
in other dom ##ains - - the world of communication ##s .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele ##phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
you rent ##ed your phone . you didn ' t buy it .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un ##lim ##ited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one - - the m ##p ##3 player , nose hair tri ##mmer , and cre ##me bru ##le ##e tor ##ch .
and if by some chance you haven ' t seen that in your store yet , you can rest ass ##ured that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their store ##s asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is " no . "
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn ' t do too much .
so , in other aspect ##s of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care - - it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , " well , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? "
and you say , " doc , what should i do ? "
and the doc says , " a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? "
and you say , " if you were me , doc , what would you do ? "
and the doc says , " but i ' m not you . "
and the result is - - we call it " patient autonom ##y , " which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shift ##ing of the bur ##den and the responsibility for decision - making from somebody who knows something - - name ##ly , the doctor - - to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th ##us not in the best shape to be making decisions - - name ##ly , the patient .
there ' s enormous marketing of presc ##ript ##ion drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can ' t buy them .
why do they market to us if we can ' t buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our presc ##ript ##ions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indic ##ate .
we don ' t inher ##it an identity ; we get to invent it .
and we get to re - invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the def ##ault assum ##ption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
now ##ada ##ys , everything is very much up for grab ##s .
i teach wonderful ##ly intelligent students , and i assign 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it ' s not because they ' re less smart , and it ' s not because they ' re less di ##li ##gen ##t .
it ' s because they are pre ##oc ##c ##up ##ied , asking themselves , " should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? "
all of these are consum ##ing questions .
and they ' re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my course ##s .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work - - we are ble ##ss ##ed , as car ##l was point ##ing out , with the technology that enable ##s us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet - - except the rand ##ol ##ph hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that i ' m not going to tell anybody about , where the w ##if ##i works .
i ' m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn ' t be working .
we can go to watch our kid play soc ##cer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our black ##ber ##ry on our other hip , and our laptop , pres ##um ##ably , on our la ##ps .
and even if they ' re all shut off , every minute that we ' re watching our kid mut ##ila ##te a soc ##cer game , we are also asking ourselves , " should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i dra ##ft this letter ? "
and even if the answer to the question is " no , " it ' s certainly going to make the experience of your kid ' s soc ##cer game very different than it would ' ve been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what ' s good about it , so i ' m going to talk about what ' s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradox ##ically , is that it produce ##s paraly ##s ##is , rather than liber ##ation .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i ' ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of investment ##s in vol ##unt ##ary ret ##ire ##ment plans .
a colleag ##ue of mine got access to investment records from van ##gu ##ard , the gig ##antic mut ##ual fund company of about a million employees and about 2 , 000 different work ##place ##s .
and what she found is that for every 10 mut ##ual fund ##s the employe ##r offered , rate of particip ##ation went down two percent .
you offer 50 fund ##s - - 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 50 fund ##s to choose from , it ' s so dam ##n hard to decide which fund to choose that you ' ll just put it off until tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they ret ##ire because they don ' t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant match ##ing money from the employe ##r .
by not particip ##ating , they are pass ##ing up as much as 5 , 000 dollars a year from the employe ##r , who would happ ##ily match their contrib ##ution .
so paraly ##s ##is is a consequence of having too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it ' s for all et ##ern ##ity , right ?
you don ' t want to pick the wrong mut ##ual fund , or even the wrong sal ##ad dress ##ing .
so that ' s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over ##come the paraly ##s ##is and make a choice , we end up less satisf ##ied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal ##ad dress ##ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it ' s not perfect - - and , you know , what sal ##ad dress ##ing is ? - - it ' s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagine ##d alternative ind ##uc ##es you to reg ##ret the decision you made , and this reg ##ret subt ##ract ##s from the satisf ##action you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more options there are , the easier it is to reg ##ret anything at all that is disapp ##o ##int ##ing about the option that you chose .
second , what economists call " opportunity costs . "
dan g ##il ##bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of alternative ##s to consider , it is easy to imagine the attract ##ive features of alternative ##s that you re ##ject , that make you less satisf ##ied with the alternative that you ' ve chose ##n .
here ' s an example . for those of you who aren ' t new yorker ##s , i ap ##olog ##ize .
but here ' s what you ' re supposed to be thinking .
here ' s this couple on the ham ##pt ##ons .
very expensive real est ##ate .
go ##r ##ge ##ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? " well , dam ##n it , " this guy is thinking , " it ' s august .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
i could be parking right in front of my building . "
and he spend ##s two weeks na ##g ##ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs subt ##ract from the satisf ##action we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terr ##ific .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attract ##ive features of these options are going to be refle ##cted by us as opportunity costs .
here ' s another example .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you ' re cho ##osing one thing , you ' re cho ##osing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attract ##ive features , and it ' s going to make what you ' re doing less attract ##ive .
third : esc ##ala ##t ##ion of expect ##ations .
this hit me when i went to replace my je ##ans .
i wear je ##ans almost all the time .
and there was a time when je ##ans came in one fl ##avor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra ##p , and they were incredibly uncom ##fort ##able , and if you wor ##e them long enough and wash ##ed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
so i went to replace my je ##ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , " i want a pair of je ##ans . here ' s my size . "
and the shop ##ke ##ep ##er said , " do you want sl ##im fit , easy fit , rel ##ax ##ed fit ?
you want button fly or z ##ippe ##r fly ? you want stone ##was ##he ##d or ac ##id - wash ##ed ?
do you want them distr ##essed ?
you want boot cut , you want tape ##red , bl ##ah bl ##ah bl ##ah . . . " on and on he went .
my ja ##w dropped , and after i recover ##ed , i said , " i want the kind that used to be the only kind . "
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam ##n je ##ans , and i walked out of the store - - truth ! - - with the best - fit ##ting je ##ans i had ever had .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expect ##ations about how good a pair of je ##ans should be went up .
i had very low - - i had no particular expect ##ations when they only came in one fl ##avor .
when they came in 100 fl ##avor ##s , dam ##n it , one of them should ' ve been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn ' t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was disapp ##o ##int ##ing in compar ##ison to what i expected .
add ##ing options to people ' s lives can ' t help but increase the expect ##ations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that ' s going to produce is less satisf ##action with results , even when they ' re good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn ' t all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas ##ant surprise .
now ##ada ##ys , the world we live in - - we aff ##lu ##ent , industrial ##ized citizens , with perfect ##ion the expect ##ation - - the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be pleas ##antly surprised because your expect ##ations , my expect ##ations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness - - this is what you all came for - - the secret to happiness is low expect ##ations .
i want to say - - just a little auto ##bi ##ograph ##ical moment - - that i actually am married to a wife , and she ' s really quite wonderful .
i couldn ' t have done better . i didn ' t sett ##le .
but sett ##ling isn ' t always such a bad thing .
finally , one consequence of buying a bad - fit ##ting pair of je ##ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are diss ##ati ##s ##f ##ied , and you ask why , who ' s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different style ##s of je ##ans available , and you buy one that is disapp ##o ##int ##ing , and you ask why , who ' s responsible ?
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je ##ans on display , there is no exc ##use for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disapp ##o ##inted about them ; they bl ##ame themselves .
clinical depression has explod ##ed in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant - - not the only , but a significant - - contrib ##ut ##or to this explosion of depression , and also su ##icide , is that people have experiences that are disapp ##o ##int ##ing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they ' re at fa ##ult .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , object ##ively , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dog ##ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it ' s all false . it is not true .
there ' s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn ' t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there ' s some magic ##al amount . i don ' t know what it is .
i ' m pretty conf ##ident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our wel ##far ##e .
now , as a policy matter - - i ' m almost done - - as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what enable ##s all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff ##lu ##ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff i ' m talking about is the pe ##cul ##iar problem of modern , aff ##lu ##ent , western societies .
and what is so frustr ##ating and inf ##ur ##iat ##ing is this : steve le ##vit ##t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult - to - install child seat ##s don ' t help . it ' s a waste of money .
what i ' m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices - - it ' s not simply that they don ' t help .
they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what enable ##s people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shift ##ed to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people ' s lives be improve ##d , but ours would be improve ##d also .
this is what economists call a " par ##et ##o - improv ##ing move . "
income red ##ist ##ribution will make everyone better off - - not just poor people - - because of how all this exc ##ess choice pl ##ag ##ues us .
so to concl ##ude . you ' re supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , " ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this fish ##bo ##w ##l . "
imp ##over ##ished imagination , a my ##op ##ic view of the world - - and that ' s the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh ##atter the fish ##bo ##w ##l so that everything is possible , you don ' t have freedom . you have paraly ##s ##is .
if you sh ##atter this fish ##bo ##w ##l so that everything is possible , you decre ##ase satisf ##action .
you increase paraly ##s ##is , and you decre ##ase satisf ##action .
everybody needs a fish ##bo ##w ##l .
this one is almost certainly too limited - - perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the abs ##ence of some metaphor ##ical fish ##bo ##w ##l is a rec ##ipe for mis ##ery , and , i susp ##ect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i ' ve talked about some of these projects before - - about the human genome and what that might mean , and discover ##ing new sets of genes .
we ' re actually starting at a new point : we ' ve been digit ##izing biology , and now we ' re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synth ##es ##izing life .
so , we ' ve always been trying to ask big questions .
" what is life ? " is something that i think many biolog ##ists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we ' ve tried various approach ##es , par ##ing it down to minim ##al components .
we ' ve been digit ##izing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequence ##d the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we ' re trying to ask , " can we regener ##ate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
this is the map of a small organism , my ##co ##pl ##as ##ma gen ##ital ##ium , that has the small ##est genome for a species that can self - repl ##icate in the laboratory , and we ' ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we ' re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its metabol ##ic map , it ' s relatively simple compared to ours - - trust me , this is simple - - but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it ' s very unlike ##ly that this would yield a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synth ##es ##ize this chromos ##ome so we could var ##y the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synth ##es ##ize a chromos ##ome ?
can chemistry per ##mit making these really large molecules where we ' ve never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromos ##ome ?
a chromos ##ome , by the way , is just a piece of ine ##rt chemical material .
so , our pac ##e of digit ##izing life has been increasing at an expon ##ential pac ##e .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an expon ##ential curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several stage ##s , in fact , starting with a bio ##eth ##ical review before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synth ##es ##izing dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna - - 30 to 50 letters in length - - and it ' s a deg ##ene ##rate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more error ##s there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the error ##s .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph ##i x ##1 ##7 ##4 .
it ' s a small virus that kill ##s bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correct ##ion and had a dna molecule of about 5 , 000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of ine ##rt chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vir ##al particles .
the vir ##al particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e . col ##i .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they laugh ##ed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteria ##l chromos ##ome - - it ' s over 5 ##8 ##0 , 000 letters of genetic code - - so we thought we ' d build them in cas ##set ##tes the size of the viruses so we could actually var ##y the cas ##set ##tes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you ' re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequence ##d this genome in 199 ##5 , the standard of accur ##acy was one error per 10 , 000 base pair ##s .
we actually found , on res ##e ##quen ##cing it , 30 error ##s ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be boot ##ed up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over ##la ##p with all the other 50 - letter pieces to build smaller sub ##un ##its we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water ##mark ##s in .
think of this : we have a four - letter genetic code - - a , c , g and t .
trip ##let ##s of those letters code for roughly 20 am ##ino ac ##ids , such that there ' s a single letter design ##ation for each of the am ##ino ac ##ids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentence ##s , thoughts .
initi ##ally , all we did was auto ##gra ##ph it .
some people were disapp ##o ##inted there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just che ##w back with enzy ##me ##s ; there are enzy ##me ##s that repair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5 , 000 to 7 , 000 letters , put those together to make 24 , 000 - letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72 , 000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abund ##ance so we could sequence them because we ' re trying to create a process that ' s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we ' re trying to get to the point of automat ##ion .
so , this looks like a bas ##ket ##ball play ##off .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100 , 000 base pair ##s , they won ' t any longer grow read ##ily in e . col ##i - - it ex ##haus ##ts all the modern tools of molecular biology - - and so we turned to other mechanism ##s .
we knew there ' s a mechanism called homo ##lo ##go ##us rec ##om ##bi ##na ##t ##ion that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together .
here ' s an example of it : there ' s an organism called dein ##oc ##oc ##c ##us radio ##du ##ra ##ns that can take three millions rad ##s of radiation .
you can see in the top pan ##el , its chromos ##ome just gets blow ##n apart .
twe ##lv ##e to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally des ##ic ##ca ##ted ; they can live in a vac ##uum .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in out ##er space , move around , find a new aqu ##e ##ous environment .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
here ' s an actual micro ##gra ##ph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using ye ##ast mechanism ##s with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye ##ast puts them together automatically .
this is not an electron micro ##gra ##ph ; this is just a regular photo ##mi ##c ##ro ##gra ##ph .
it ' s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
these are pictures over about a six - second period .
so , this is the public ##ation we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5 ##8 ##0 , 000 letters of genetic code ; it ' s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it ' s over 300 million molecular weight .
if we print ##ed it out at a 10 fo ##nt with no sp ##acing , it takes 14 ##2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chromos ##ome ? how do we activ ##ate this ?
obviously , with a virus it ' s pretty simple ; it ' s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it ' s also simple ##r when you go into eu ##ka ##ry ##ote ##s like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu ##cle ##us and pop in another one , and that ' s what you ' ve all heard about with cl ##on ##ing .
with bacteria and arch ##ae ##a , the chromos ##ome is integr ##ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromos ##ome from one cell to another and activ ##ate it .
we pur ##ified a chromos ##ome from one micro ##bi ##al species - - roughly , these two are as distant as human and mic ##e - - we added a few extra genes so we could sele ##ct for this chromos ##ome , we dig ##est ##ed it with enzy ##me ##s to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun ##ning when we put this in the cell - - and you ' ll appreciate our very sophisticated graph ##ics here .
the new chromos ##ome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromos ##ome or a third one from somewhere , add ##ing thousands of new tra ##its in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have miss ##ed much of biology .
there are enzy ##me ##s called rest ##ric ##t ##ion enzy ##me ##s that actually dig ##est dna .
the chromos ##ome that was in the cell doesn ' t have one ; the chromos ##ome we put in does .
it got express ##ed and it recognize ##d the other chromos ##ome as foreign material , che ##we ##d it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromos ##ome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the character ##istics of one species were lost and it conver ##ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the mem ##bra ##nes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it ' s exactly what we had transfer ##red in .
so , this may sound like genom ##ic al ##chem ##y , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dramatically .
now i ' ve argue ##d , this is not genes ##is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and i ' ve argue ##d that we ' re about to perhaps create a new version of the cambr ##ian explosion , where there ' s massive new spec ##iation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we ' re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 194 ##6 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 194 ##6 ; within 40 years , there ' ll be four .
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicine ##s , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it ' s going to be a stret ##ch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion - plus barr ##els of oil - - that ' s a hundred million barr ##els a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it ' s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there ' s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a data ##bas ##e with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electronic ##s industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we ' re limited here prim ##arily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid method ##s of synth ##esis , to do what we ' re calling comb ##ina ##to ##ria ##l genom ##ics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromos ##omes a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optim ##ize processes to produce oct ##ane or to produce pharm ##ace ##ut ##ical ##s , new vaccine ##s , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it ' s just standard selection : we can sele ##ct for vi ##ability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen sn ##aps ##ho ##t of some true design software that we ' re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don ' t know necessarily what it ' ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we ' re focus ##ing on now fourth - generation fuels .
you ' ve seen recently , corn to ethan ##ol is just a bad experiment .
we have second - and third - generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher - value fuels like oct ##ane or different types of but ##an ##ol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limit ##ing its avail ##ability is if we start with co2 as its feed ##stock , and so we ' re working with designing cells to go down this road .
and we think we ' ll have the first fourth - generation fuels in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is one method . . .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other method ##s .
this is an organism we described in 199 ##6 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo ##iling - water temperature ##s .
it takes co2 to meth ##ane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we ' re looking to see if we can take capture ##d co2 , which can easily be pip ##ed to sites , conver ##t that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of " what is life ? "
we truly , you know , have mode ##st goals of repl ##acing the whole pet ##ro ##l - chemical industry - - yeah . if you can ' t do that at ted , where can you ? - - become a major source of energy . . .
but also , we ' re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst ##ant sets of vaccine ##s .
you ' ve seen this year with flu ; we ' re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building comb ##ina ##to ##ria ##l vaccine ##s in adv ##ance .
here ' s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speed ##ing up evolution with synthetic bacteria , arch ##ae ##a and , eventually , eu ##ka ##ry ##ote ##s .
we ' re a ways away from improv ##ing people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at ted i gave an introdu ##ction to the l ##h ##c .
and i promise ##d to come back and give you an up ##da ##te on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren ' t there , the l ##h ##c is the largest scientific experiment ever attempt ##ed - - 27 kilometers in circum ##feren ##ce .
its job is to rec ##reat ##e the conditions that were present less than a billion ##th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it ' s nothing if not amb ##iti ##ous .
this is the machine below gene ##va .
we take the pictures of those mini - big bang ##s inside detect ##ors .
this is the one i work on . it ' s called the atl ##as detect ##or - - 4 ##4 meters wide , 22 meters in diam ##eter .
spect ##ac ##ular picture here of atl ##as under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10 ##th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atl ##as .
it caused immen ##se celebr ##ation in the control room .
it ' s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the l ##h ##c , coll ##iding with a piece of the l ##h ##c del ##iber ##ately , and show ##ering particles into the detect ##or .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10 ##th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri ##ump ##h .
i don ' t know whether this got the biggest che ##er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here - - these gold wire ##s .
those wire ##s carry 13 thousand amp ##s when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers among ##st you will look at them and say , " no they don ' t . they ' re small wire ##s . "
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what ' s called super ##con ##duc ##ting wire .
so at minus 27 ##1 degrees , cold ##er than the space between the stars , those wire ##s can take that current .
in one of the join ##ts between over 9 , 000 magnet ##s in l ##h ##c , there was a manufacturing defe ##ct .
so the wire heat ##ed up slightly , and its 13 , 000 amp ##s suddenly encounter ##ed electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now that ' s more impress ##ive when you consider those magnet ##s weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we damage ##d about 50 of the magnet ##s .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we recon ##dition ##ed them all , fix ##ed them .
they ' re all on their way back under ##ground now .
by the end of march the l ##h ##c will be int ##act again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in jun ##e or jul ##y , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those accident ##s rei ##gn ##ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it ' s easy to ref ##ute .
i think that the fact that it ' s so difficult , the fact that we ' re over ##re ##ach ##ing , is the value of things like the l ##h ##c .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hum ##ph ##re ##y dav ##y , who , i susp ##ect , when defen ##ding his prote ##ge ' s use ##less experiments - - his prote ##ge was michael far ##ada ##y - - said this , " nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assum ##e that our view ##s of science are ultimate , that there are no myster ##ies in nature , that our tri ##ump ##h ##s are complete , and that there are no new worlds to con ##que ##r . "
thank you .
i am a writer .
writing books is my profession but it ' s more than that , of course .
it is also my great life ##lo ##ng love and fascin ##ation .
and i don ' t expect that that ' s ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of pe ##cul ##iar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec ##al ##ibr ##ate my whole relationship with this work .
and the pe ##cul ##iar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this mem ##o ##ir called " eat , pra ##y , love " which , decided ##ly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega - sens ##ation , international best ##sel ##ler thing .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i ' m do ##ome ##d .
seriously - - do ##ome ##d , do ##ome ##d !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , " aren ' t you afraid - - aren ' t you afraid you ' re never going to be able to top that ?
aren ' t you afraid you ' re going to keep writing for your whole life and you ' re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world care ##s about at all , ever again ? "
so that ' s reas ##s ##uring , you know .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people - - when i was a teenager - - that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fear - based reaction .
and people would say , " aren ' t you afraid you ' re never going to have any success ?
aren ' t you afraid the hum ##il ##iation of re ##ject ##ion will kill you ?
aren ' t you afraid that you ' re going to work your whole life at this cra ##ft and nothing ' s ever going to come of it and you ' re going to die on a sc ##ra ##p he ##ap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitte ##r as ##h of failure ? "
like that , you know .
the answer - - the short answer to all those questions is , " yes . "
yes , i ' m afraid of all those things .
and i always have been .
and i ' m afraid of many , many more things bes ##ides that people can ' t even guess at .
like sea ##we ##ed , and other things that are scary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i ' ve been sort of thinking about late ##ly , and wondering about late ##ly , is why ?
you know , is it rational ?
is it logic ##al that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative vent ##ures that seems to make us really nervous about each other ' s mental health in a way that other career ##s kind of don ' t do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don ' t rec ##all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn ' t - - that chemical engineering block john , how ' s it going ?
it just didn ' t come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven ' t really earn ##ed a reputation over the centuries for being al ##co ##hol ##ic man ##ic - depress ##ives .
we writer ##s , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writer ##s , but creative people across all gen ##res , it seems , have this reputation for being enormous ##ly mental ##ly uns ##t ##able .
and all you have to do is look at the very gr ##im death count in the 20th century alone , of really magn ##ific ##ent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn ' t literally commit su ##icide seem to be really und ##one by their gift ##s , you know .
norm ##an mail ##er , just before he died , last interview , he said " every one of my books has killed me a little more . "
an extraordinary statement to make about your life ' s work , you know .
but we don ' t even bl ##ink when we hear somebody say this because we ' ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we ' ve completely internal ##ized and accept ##ed collective ##ly this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inher ##ently linked and that artist ##ry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to ang ##u ##ish .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that - - because you look at it even from an inc ##h away and , you know - - i ' m not at all comfortable with that assum ##ption .
i think it ' s od ##ious .
and i also think it ' s dangerous , and i don ' t want to see it per ##pet ##ua ##ted into the next century .
i think it ' s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
and i definitely know that , in my case - - in my situation - - it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea ##king down that dark path of assum ##ption , particularly given the circumst ##ance that i ' m in right now in my career .
which is - - you know , like check it out , i ' m pretty young , i ' m only about 40 years old .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it ' s exc ##e ##ed ##ingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judge ##d by the world as the work that came after the fre ##ak ##ish success of my last book , right ?
i should just put it bl ##unt ##ly , because we ' re all sort of friends here now - - it ' s exc ##e ##ed ##ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , so jesus , what a thought !
you know that ' s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking g ##in at nine o ' clock in the morning , and i don ' t want to go there .
i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of refle ##ction , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of protect ##ive psychological constru ##ct , right ?
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural anx ##iety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and , as i ' ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i ' ve been sort of looking across time , and i ' ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san ##er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inher ##ent emotional risks of creativity .
and that search has led me to ancient gree ##ce and ancient rom ##e .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient gree ##ce and ancient rom ##e - - people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o . k . ?
people believed that creativity was this div ##ine att ##end ##ant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unkn ##ow ##able source , for distant and unkn ##ow ##able reasons .
the gree ##ks famous ##ly called these div ##ine att ##end ##ant spirit ##s of creativity " da ##em ##ons . "
soc ##rate ##s , famous ##ly , believed that he had a da ##em ##on who spoke wisdom to him from af ##ar .
the roman ##s had the same idea , but they called that sort of dise ##m ##bod ##ied creative spirit a genius .
which is great , because the roman ##s did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of magic ##al div ##ine ent ##ity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist ' s studio , kind of like do ##b ##by the house el ##f , and who would come out and sort of invis ##ibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
so brilliant - - there it is , right there , that distance that i ' m talking about - - that psychological constru ##ct to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it function ##ed , right ?
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much nar ##ci ##ss ##ism , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn ' t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dise ##m ##bod ##ied genius who had helped you .
if your work bomb ##ed , not entirely your fa ##ult , you know ?
everyone knew your genius was kind of lam ##e .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
and then the ren ##ai ##ss ##ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let ' s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all god ##s and myster ##ies , and there ' s no more room for my ##stic ##al creatures who take dict ##ation from the div ##ine .
and it ' s the beginning of rational human ##ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer ##ring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
you know , i think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the fo ##nt and the essen ##ce and the source of all div ##ine , creative , unkn ##ow ##able , et ##ern ##al mystery is just a sm ##idge too much responsibility to put on one frag ##ile , human psych ##e .
it ' s like asking somebody to sw ##allow the sun .
it just completely war ##ps and dist ##ort ##s ego ##s , and it creates all these un ##man ##age ##able expect ##ations about performance .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
maybe not .
maybe we can ' t just era ##se 500 years of rational human ##istic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and there ' s probably people in this audience who would raise really legit ##imate scientific susp ##ic ##ions about the notion of , basically fair ##ies who follow people around rub ##bing fair ##y ju ##ice on their projects and stuff .
i ' m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that i kind of want to pos ##e is - - you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explain ##ing the ut ##ter mad ##den ##ing cap ##ric ##ious ##ness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something - - which is to say basically everyone here - - - knows does not always behav ##e rational ##ly .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down ##right par ##an ##or ##mal .
i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet rut ##h stone , who ' s now in her 90 ##s , but she ' s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
and she said it was like a th ##under ##ous train of air .
and it would come barr ##el ##ing down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , " run like hell . "
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting cha ##sed by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen ##cil fast enough so that when it th ##under ##ed through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
and other times she wouldn ' t be fast enough , so she ' d be running and running and running , and she wouldn ' t get to the house and the poem would barr ##el through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it " for another poet . "
and then there were these times - - this is the piece i never forg ##ot - - she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she ' s running to the house and she ' s looking for the paper and the poem pass ##es through her , and she grab ##s a pen ##cil just as it ' s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it back ##wards into her body as she was transc ##rib ##ing on the page .
and in these instance ##s , the poem would come up on the page perfect and int ##act but back ##wards , from the last word to the first .
so when i heard that i was like - - that ' s unc ##ann ##y , that ' s exactly what my creative process is like .
that ' s not at all what my creative process is - - i ' m not the pip ##eline !
i ' m a mu ##le , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe ##at and labor and barr ##el through it really aw ##k ##ward ##ly .
but even i , in my mu ##li ##sh ##ness , even i have bru ##sh ##ed up against that thing , at times .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i honest ##ly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san ##e ?
and for me , the best contem ##por ##ary example that i have of how to do that is the music ##ian tom wait ##s , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assign ##ment .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the em ##bod ##iment of the tor ##mented contem ##por ##ary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin ##ate these sort of unc ##ont ##roll ##able creative imp ##ulse ##s that were totally internal ##ized .
but then he got older , he got cal ##mer , and one day he was driving down the free ##way in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
and he ' s speed ##ing along , and all of a sudden he hear ##s this little frag ##ment of mel ##ody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el ##usive and ta ##nt ##al ##izing , and he wants it , you know , it ' s go ##r ##ge ##ous , and he long ##s for it , but he has no way to get it .
he doesn ' t have a piece of paper , he doesn ' t have a pen ##cil , he doesn ' t have a tape record ##er .
so he starts to feel all of that old anx ##iety start to rise in him like , " i ' m going to lose this thing , and then i ' m going to be hau ##nte ##d by this song forever .
i ' m not good enough , and i can ' t do it . "
and instead of pan ##ick ##ing , he just stopped .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , " exc ##use me , can you not see that i ' m driving ? "
" do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opportun ##e moment when i can take care of you .
otherwise , go both ##er somebody else today .
go both ##er leon ##ard co ##hen . "
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still often ##time ##s as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy anx ##iety around it was released when he took the gen ##ie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn ' t have to be this internal ##ized , tor ##mented thing .
it could be this pe ##cul ##iar , won ##dro ##us , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ext ##ern ##al thing that was not quite tom .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing " eat , pra ##y , love , " and i fell into one of those , sort of p ##its of desp ##air that we all fall into when we ' re working on something and it ' s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and i started to think i should just dum ##p this project .
but then i remember ##ed tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
so i just lift ##ed my face up from the man ##us ##c ##ript and i direct ##ed my comment ##s to an empty corner of the room .
and i said al ##oud , " listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn ' t brilliant that is not entirely my fa ##ult , right ?
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don ' t have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you ' ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
o . k . but if you don ' t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
i ' m going to keep writing anyway because that ' s my job .
and i would please like the record to refle ##ct today that i showed up for my part of the job . "
because - - in the end it ' s like this , o . k . - - centuries ago in the desert ##s of north africa , people used to gather for these moon ##light dance ##s of sac ##red dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da ##wn .
and they were always magn ##ific ##ent , because the dance ##r ##s were professional ##s and they were terr ##ific , right ?
but every once in a while , very rare ##ly , something would happen , and one of these perform ##ers would actually become transc ##enden ##t .
and i know you know what i ' m talking about , because i know you ' ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it was like time would stop , and the dance ##r would sort of step through some kind of port ##al and he wasn ' t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1 , 000 night ##s before , but everything would al ##ign .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mere ##ly human .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with div ##ini ##ty .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to cha ##nt , " all ##ah , all ##ah , all ##ah , god , god , god . "
that ' s god , you know .
curious histor ##ical foot ##not ##e - - when the mo ##ors inv ##ade ##d southern sp ##ain , they took this custom with them and the pro ##n ##un ##ci ##ation changed over the centuries from " all ##ah , all ##ah , all ##ah , " to " ol ##e , ol ##e , ol ##e , " which you still hear in bull ##fig ##ht ##s and in fl ##ame ##n ##co dance ##s .
in sp ##ain , when a perform ##er has done something impossible and magic , " all ##ah , ol ##e , ol ##e , all ##ah , magn ##ific ##ent , bra ##vo , " inc ##om ##pre ##hen ##s ##ible , there it is - - a gl ##imp ##se of god .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the trick ##y bit comes the next morning , for the dance ##r himself , when he wake ##s up and discover ##s that it ' s tue ##s ##day at 11 a . m . , and he ' s no longer a gl ##imp ##se of god .
he ' s just an aging mort ##al with really bad knee ##s , and maybe he ' s never going to as ##cen ##d to that height again .
and maybe nobody will ever cha ##nt god ' s name again as he spin ##s , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most painful recon ##cil ##iation ##s to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn ' t have to be quite so full of ang ##u ##ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspect ##s of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on lo ##an to you from some uni ##ma ##gin ##able source for some ex ##qu ##is ##ite port ##ion of your life to be passed along when you ' re finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is how i ' ve started to think , and this is certainly how i ' ve been thinking in the last few months as i ' ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerous ##ly , frighten ##ingly over - anti ##ci ##pa ##ted follow up to my fre ##ak ##ish success .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psych ##ed out about that , is , don ' t be afraid .
don ' t be dau ##nte ##d .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the div ##ine , co ##cke ##y ##ed genius assign ##ed to your case decide ##s to let some sort of wonder ##ment be gl ##imp ##sed , for just one moment through your effort ##s , then " ol ##e ! "
and if not , do your dance any ##how .
and " ol ##e ! " to you , none ##the ##less .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
" ol ##e ! " to you , none ##the ##less , just for having the she ##er human love and stu ##b ##bor ##n ##ness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
ol ##e !
last year i showed these two slides so that demonstr ##ate that the ar ##ctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shr ##unk by 40 percent .
but this under ##sta ##tes the serious ##ness of this particular problem because it doesn ' t show the thick ##ness of the ice .
the ar ##ctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beat ##ing heart of the global climate system .
it expand ##s in winter and contra ##cts in summer .
the next slide i show you will be a rapid fast - forward of what ' s happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is marke ##d in red .
as you see , it expand ##s to the dark blue - - that ' s the ann ##ual ice in winter , and it contra ##cts in summer .
the so - called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp ##illing out of the body here .
in 25 years it ' s gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming heat ##s up the fro ##zen ground around the ar ##ctic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro ##zen carbon which , when it th ##aw ##s , is turned into meth ##ane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this t ##ipping point .
already in some shall ##ow lake ##s in al ##as ##ka , meth ##ane is active ##ly bub ##bling up out of the water .
professor kat ##e ##y wal ##ter from the university of al ##as ##ka went out with another team to another shall ##ow lake last winter .
who ##a !
she ' s okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin ##k heat ##s up green ##land from the north .
this is an ann ##ual melt ##ing river .
but the volume ##s are much larger than ever .
this is the kan ##ger ##lu ##ss ##ua ##q river in south ##west green ##land .
if you want to know how sea level rise ##s from land - base ice melt ##ing this is where it reach ##es the sea .
these flow ##s are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , antar ##ctic ##a the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists report ##ed the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west antar ##ctic ##a cro ##pped up on top some under - sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melt ##ing .
that ' s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green ##land .
in the him ##ala ##ya ##s , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lake ##s , which a few years ago were gl ##ac ##iers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melt ##ing flow .
in the and ##es , this gl ##ac ##ier is the source of drinking water for this city .
the flow ##s have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the sie ##r ##ra snow ##pack .
this is hit ##ting the reser ##vo ##ir ##s .
and the predict ##ions , as you ' ve read , are serious .
this dry ##ing around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fire ##s .
and the disaster ##s around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un ##pre ##ced ##ente ##d rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely uns ##ustain ##able pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we ' ve added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours - - 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the america ##s , extend ##ing west ##ward , and on either side of the indian sub ##con ##t ##inen ##t , where there is a radical dep ##let ##ion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with def ##orest ##ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the united states is one of the two largest em ##itter ##s , along with china .
and the prop ##os ##al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we ' re beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been can ##cell ##ed in the last few years with some green alternative ##s prop ##osed .
however there is a political battle in our country .
and the coal industrie ##s and the oil industrie ##s spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last cal ##end ##ar year prom ##ot ##ing clean coal , which is an oxy ##mor ##on .
that image remind ##ed me of something .
around christmas , in my home in tenn ##esse ##e , a billion gall ##ons of coal sl ##ud ##ge was sp ##illed .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
this happened around christmas .
one of the coal industry ' s ad ##s around christmas was this one .
fro ##st ##y the coal man is a jo ##lly , happy soul .
he ' s abund ##ant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
fro ##st ##y the coal man is getting clean ##er everyday .
he ' s afford ##able and ad ##ora ##ble , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
the largest mountain ##to ##p miner is the head of masse ##y coal .
let me be clear about it . al gore , nan ##cy pe ##los ##i , har ##ry rei ##d , they don ' t know what they ' re talking about .
so the all ##ian ##ce for climate protection has launched two campaign ##s .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
at coal ##erg ##y we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that ' s why we ' ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complic ##ate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn ' t dirty .
we think it ' s clean - - smell ##s good , too .
so don ' t worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
clean coal - - you ' ve heard a lot about it .
so let ' s take a tour of this state - of - the - art clean coal fac ##ility .
amazing ! the machine ##ry is kind of loud .
but that ' s the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today ' s clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative me ##sh ##es with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
america is in crisis - - the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thr ##e ##ad that links them all : our add ##iction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bol ##d new solution to get us out of this mess .
rep ##ower america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more sec ##ure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that ' s big enough to solve our problems .
rep ##ower america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it ' s about rep ##ower ##ing america .
one of the fast ##est ways to cut our depend ##ence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
future ' s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new investment ##s to create high - paying jobs .
rep ##ower america . it ' s time to get real .
there is an old african prove ##r ##b that says , " if you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . "
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras ##p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipul ##ating sp ##ati ##al relationships .
sp ##ati ##al reason ##ing is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this ut ##ility of our interaction ##s with physical objects - - along with my adv ##ise ##r pat ##t ##ie , and my collabor ##ator je ##e ##va ##n kal ##ani ##th ##i - - i started to wonder - - what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur ##so ##r that was a like a digital finger ##t ##ip moving around a flat desk ##to ##p , what if we could reach in with both hands and gras ##p information physically , arrang ##ing it the way we wanted ?
this question was so comp ##ell ##ing that we decided to explore the answer , by building s ##ift ##ables .
in a nut ##sh ##ell , a s ##ift ##able is an interactive computer the size of a cook ##ie .
they ' re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
most importantly , they ' re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach ##ing out and gras ##ping .
and s ##ift ##ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipul ##ating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu ##ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction style ##s .
so , i ' m going to start with some simple examples .
this s ##ift ##able is conf ##ig ##ured to show video , and if i t ##ilt it in one direction , it ' ll roll the video this way ; if i t ##ilt it the other way it roll ##s it back ##wards .
and these interactive portrait ##s are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu ##ster ##ed .
and they can also sense their motion and t ##ilt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gest ##ures on data , like pour ##ing a color the way we might pour a liquid .
so in this case , we ' ve got three s ##ift ##ables conf ##ig ##ured to be paint buck ##ets and i can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mix ##ed .
if we over ##sh ##oot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are also some ne ##at possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here i ' m - - this is a fi ##bon ##ac ##ci sequence that i ' m making with a simple equation program .
here we have a word game that ' s kind of like a mas ##h - up between sc ##rab ##ble and bo ##g ##gle .
basically , in every round you get a random ##ly assign ##ed letter on each s ##ift ##able , and as you try to make words it check ##s against a diction ##ary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res ##h ##uf ##fle ##s , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don ' t have to give people many instru ##ctions .
all you have to say is , " make words , " and they know exactly what to do .
so here ' s another few people trying it out .
that ' s our young ##est bet ##a test ##er , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the s ##ift ##ables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learn ##ers .
and this is fel ##ix , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lift ##ing the s ##ift ##ables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he ' s bringing the sun out .
the sun is rising .
now he ' s brought a tra ##ctor into the scene .
the orange tra ##ctor .
good job ! yeah !
so by sh ##aking the s ##ift ##ables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact - - woo ##f !
invent ##ing his own narrative .
hello !
it ' s an open - ended story , and he gets to decide how it unf ##old ##s .
fly away , cat .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequen ##cing and live performance tool that we ' ve built recently , in which s ##ift ##ables act as sounds like lead , bas ##s and dru ##ms .
each of these has four different variation ##s , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can inj ##ect these sounds into a sequence that you can assem ##ble into the pattern that you want .
and you inj ##ect it by just bu ##mp ##ing up the sound s ##ift ##able against a sequence s ##ift ##able .
there are effects that you can control live , like reve ##r ##b and filter .
you attach it to a particular sound and then t ##ilt to adjust it .
and then , over ##all effects like tem ##po and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let ' s have a look .
we ' ll start by putting a lead into two sequence s ##ift ##ables , arrang ##e them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
now i put a bas ##s line in .
now i ' ll put some per ##c ##ussion in .
and now i ' ll attach the filter to the dru ##ms , so i can control the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by t ##ilt ##ing the tem ##po one way or the other .
and now i ' ll attach the filter to the bas ##s for some more expression .
i can re ##arr ##ange the sequence while it plays .
so i don ' t have to plan it out in adv ##ance , but i can improv ##ise , making it longer or short ##er as i go .
and now , finally , i can fa ##de the whole sequence out using the volume s ##ift ##able , t ##ilt ##ed to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human - computer interface ##s that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we ' re working to bring out of the laboratory .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we ' re on the c ##us ##p of this new generation of tools for interact ##ing with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
yes , hello .
i ' m happy to be here .
yes , so , what is bio ##ha ##cking ?
i ' ll have to provide some background information here , bio ##ha ##cking deal ##s with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio ##ha ##cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more detail ##ed knowledge and especially wanted to put what i ' d learned theoret ##ically into practice .
so these were my prime motiv ##es .
so it was curiosity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biote ##chn ##ology , everything that can be include ##d in that , like synthetic biology , etc .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
there are contro ##vers ##ial topic ##s such as all those genetic ##ally mod ##ified plants in the fields .
now there ' s craig vent ##er in the usa who ' s trying to produce bio ##f ##uel , biod ##ies ##el fuel made from al ##ga ##e .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing pow ##der enzy ##me ##s , which allow us to wash clothes at fort ##y degrees , which are also genetic ##ally optim ##ised enzy ##me ##s .
and the list can go on forever .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went del ##ved into it more .
so what why hack ##ing ?
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
computer hack ##ing , and then in the media it ' s yes , hack ##ers break into a place and ste ##al data and so on .
that ' s rather sad for the hack ##er community , because it doesn ' t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what ' s behind it .
software hack ##ers started building computers in the seven ##ties and eight ##ies and this gave rise to the internet .
and it deal ##s with problem - solving in a play ##ful , creative , original way .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpl ##ifying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of pos ##ing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it ' s also found in the electronic ##s sector where you also find a whole tin ##ker ##er scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circuit ##s .
and so now you find it in biology , and i ' d like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes , it ' s not exactly like a computer , because it ' s more dynamic , because it ' s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber ##net ##ic .
but it ' s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also hack into it , that ' s it , and i thought think it ' s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really del ##ve into that .
these these networks didn ' t really take form until two thousand eight .
there ' s hack ##ter ##ia dot org , which original ##ly comes from sw ##itzer ##land , and it ' s a network based in europe with a cooper ##ation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
those are it has a more art ##y character , so it ' s many artists and philosoph ##ers are working , together with scientists , on exam ##ining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creative ##ly , there are museum exhib ##itions and , well , all sorts of things .
but the point is to always find a a really lo ##ose approach to it , to deal with it play ##fully .
and then there ' s do - it - yourself - bio - dot - org , di ##y bio .
that ' s a network from the usa , that ' s more of a kind of a for ##um , where you where people can meet and discuss things online .
they are ge ##ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspect ##s of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i ' d like to brief ##ly describe .
this picture on the left is of bio ##c ##ur ##ious , that ' s a hack ##ers ##pa ##ce , so a kind of school , a private school , a non - profit organisation institution , where anybody can go to .
children , elder ##ly people , all sorts of people go there to simply exam ##ine this in a different kind of way , they ' ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory proto ##col ##s .
here in the bottom left there ' s a group in indones ##ia , house of natural fiber ##s it ' s called , but they ' ve been around for quite some time .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
they look at biological materials in an artist ##ic way and , yes , also electronic tin ##ker ##ing , and combine this in a very out ##land ##ish way .
a group from an ##ka ##ra , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organis ##ed these these little actions at street fest ##ival ##s and tried to explain dna to people .
and in this other image at the top i have a lecture in in cop ##en ##hagen at the medical muse ##ion in combination with an exhib ##ition on the topic .
and that ' s , well that ' s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really unit ##es everybody , is this fascin ##ation with technology .
and what you can do with it and approach ##ing society very target ##ed ##ly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
so , okay , to hack into biology , you need material .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that ' s a laboratory .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely distant ones , for professional staff , trained academ ##ics with a doctor ' s degree etc . only .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don ' t actually have to do that .
that ' s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that ' s really true .
and so with this prem ##ises with this prem ##ises , brian deg ##ger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini - laboratory , took a pressure cook ##er , a hot plate and , yes , sou ##p stock , and bre ##d bacteria with it , working like this .
so anybody who ' s ever had a sou ##p gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some second ##hand equipment on eb ##ay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a pat ##ern ##ity test , so dna finger ##print ##ing in other words , at home again .
that ' s not supposed to be a joke , but here in the image below you can see there ' s the laboratory , in qu ##ota ##t ##ion mark ##s , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i ' d like to brief ##ly mention a project .
that here is bio ##c ##ur ##ious , the hack ##ers ##pa ##ce i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education cent ##re for for molecular biology .
and yes , so you can see that it ' s a relatively relatively he ##ter ##ogen ##e ##ous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organisation ##s , who are doing this more formal ##ly in an institution ##al ##ised form already .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “ scene ” , and we ' re online , and we we know the people who are always cha ##tt ##ing there and everything .
and then the found ##er of do - it - yourself - bio dot org came and said : okay
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organis ##ed two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and short ##ly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
and what what are our values and what are what are our object ##ives , our fundamental principles ?
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of condu ##ct .
that was really intuitive , i mean , everyone express ##ed their wish ##es , their and things that move them .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
and that was then it ' s not bin ##ding , but it ' s yes , i think it has managed to become accept ##ed quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the academ ##ic world , but somehow it wasn ' t really well received there .
so i think we from the bio ##ha ##cker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the academ ##ic world .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
a project i set up myself with the hack ##ter ##ia network in sw ##itzer ##land , was one in which we wanted to create a so - called opt ##ical tra ##p or opt ##ical twe ##e ##zer ##s .
this is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they ' re then tra ##pped in there , so it ' s basically like a tra ##ctor beam .
that really works , it ' s done in an academ ##ic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a web ##ca ##m , dis ##man ##t ##led it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscope , which has a four hundred fold magn ##ification appro ##x ##imate ##ly .
you can see this at the bottom .
and then we took apart a dv ##d burn ##er and took out the burn ##er the laser and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately that didn ' t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any ##how .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that ' s pretty cool .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an e ##e ##g or something like that , so he was working with neur ##obi ##ology , his his nick ##nam ##e is sam neur ##oh ##ack .
he then made this this this hel ##met , and it took place in in cooper ##ation with the museum .
visit ##ors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this hel ##met .
their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the room ##we ##nt switch ##ed on .
was a very a very fan ##cy project .
another thing from the usa that also had to do with pat ##ern ##ity test thing , is the the pc ##r , the poly ##mer ##ase chain reaction , a complicated term .
this is about the copy ##ing of genes , repl ##ica ##ting genes , dna , frag ##ments , so that you can make them visible .
so when i now that ' s what the what prof ##iler ##s do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair sample ##s , and then they make these impl ##ement this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belong ##s to this person , like that .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commercial ##ly , they start at about four thousand eur ##os at the least .
and that ' s not within the range of amate ##urs , but it ' s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
so that ' s just one application among many that you can use .
and they have there were two two tin ##ker ##ers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and cheap ##er , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so free ##ly available hardware and electronic ##s and they ' re now the they ' ve now managed to make it r ##ipe for the market and are currently the the cheap ##est provide ##r ##s of these devices worldwide .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
it ' s certainly now it ' s that ' s still not cheap , but it ' s certainly within a range that makes it much more accessible .
so that was a very successful hack in my opinion .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which shoot ##s about this far , two cent ##imet ##res or so .
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at on ##ions and made them light up and stuff like that .
so the device you see here didn ' t work .
but that ' s my my prototyp ##e , which looked pretty wild though , on a bran ##ch and that , that thing on it , put the electronic ##s into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
then i took a wh ##ipped cre ##am disp ##ens ##er and connected it to that .
a wh ##ipped cre ##am disp ##ens ##er , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about fort ##y to six ##ty bar .
and with that you can acceler ##ate the particles strong ##ly enough and then they enter the on ##ions .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fif ##te ##en thousand eur ##os or so , whereas wh ##ipped cre ##am disp ##ens ##ers cost about fif ##ty eur ##os .
so the it ' s not as efficient , but it ' s basically do ##able .
so that ' s currently the the core object ##ive of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and comp ##rehen ##s ##ibility , so that that more people can get involved .
because as i said in the beginning , it ' s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educ ##ating themselves really well on it .
because if you just read about it in second ##ary literature , that ' s not the same as when you ' ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if , as an inform ##ed citi ##zen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
and this trade ##s under the names open knowledge and citi ##zen science .
so as a citi ##zen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
and that ' s that ' s the core concern of of bio ##ha ##cker ##s .
those are the people who are at least official ##ly reg ##ister ##ed on the website , the di ##y - bio - dot - org - website .
there ' s already a rather impress ##ive number of people worldwide .
and it ' s also interesting that they ' re also represent ##ed in south - east - asia .
that is i think they are less people have reg ##ister ##ed than actually exist .
i know of some people who haven ' t reg ##ister ##ed .
and they are just the bio ##ha ##cker ##s , individuals .
some of them are also reg ##ister ##ed together with the hack ##ers ##pa ##ces , those places .
and that ' s just the beginning .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
and hack ##ers ##pa ##ces , so computer hack ##ers ##pa ##ces , c - base in berlin was the first , in nine ##te ##en nine ##ty - five .
and that ' s become a gig ##antic network of very good , well , infrastructure cent ##res , which are being represent ##ed all over the world .
and of course we hope that we ' ll expand in a similar way and also be similar ##ly network ##ed , so that more people can get involved .
and i would like to inv ##ite everyone to work on it and event try something your ##selves .
it ' s not that simple , but it ' s also not impossible , and if you ' re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
thanks for listening .
that was all .
yes , hello .
how do we humans actually function ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of rele ##va ##n ##ce in the area of in the research area usa ##bil ##ity and especially in the area user experience .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisf ##ying result possible .
i think that interactive media address arch ##ai ##c , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were programme ##d into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be el ##icit ##ed through interactive media .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transport ##s you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch ##ai ##c roots .
so what are arch ##ai ##c models ?
i wrote down four key ##wor ##ds and would like to explain them brief ##ly .
arch ##ai ##c models are models that we adopt ##ed in pre - industrial times .
intr ##ins ##ic to these arch ##ai ##c models is the fact that we have a princi ##pa ##lly natural relationship with virtual ##ity .
that might sound unusual at first .
i will clar ##ify this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural rel ##ation to virtual ##ity .
and the second aspect is that since we because of these arch ##ai ##c models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual mann ##er , although we use a cod ##ified language today .
and the third area speak ##s for itself really .
we all know that interactive media is , by definition , non - linear , which involv ##es the neg ##ation of linear ##ity , and which of course tells us that we consider linear ##ity normal today .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
but how is it with with virtual ##ity , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i would like to prove that to you .
how many door ##s does the house you live in have ?
we you wouldn ' t be able to answer that spont ##aneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many door ##s there are .
that is exactly what you are doing .
you are virtual ##ising the reality without a computer .
fantastic , isn ' t it ?
at the media camp ##us , for example , we are attempt ##ing to ren ##der virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and this this ability to virtual ##ise the virtual reality was something that people in pre - industrial times bitte ##r ##ly needed , because they didn ' t have anything .
they didn ' t have books , after all .
and they didn ' t have photo ##li ##th ##ography .
they didn ' t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their mind .
and in this mind they had memory .
in this mind knowledge was ret ##rie ##ved , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
and that ' s why it is so strong ##ly root ##ed in us , this ability to deal with virtual ##ity .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
yes , that ' s possible .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simul ##t ##aneously the media produce ##r and medium .
now let ' s take that a step further .
what is the media today ?
you will notice that a change has taken place .
but i ' ll come back to that in a moment .
a cru ##cial tool in information broke ##rage has always been stories .
sh ##ama ##ns , pr ##iest ##s , so - called keep ##ers of knowledge , were special ##ly assign ##ed to preser ##ve knowledge in stories .
and today we are still very , very depend ##ent on stories .
according to the author of the book the storyte ##lling animal , jon ##athan gott ##scha ##ll , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the rece ##ption of stories .
that means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life rece ##iving stories .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the la ##p of our parents .
no , no , that ' s way off .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre - industrial cultures .
what is particularly impress ##ive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we ' ve an ##ch ##ored the ability to think in a non - linear way in our biological memory .
i brought along an example of the north american trib ##e of the no ##ot ##ka indian ##s .
they live lived in the coast ##al region of british columb ##ia .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navig ##ate through there , from island to island , to find food .
and they did this using so - called lead maps .
perhaps you ' ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the australia ##n ab ##or ##ig ##inal ##s .
they have similar principles .
they don ' t have lead maps , but used so - called song ##lines , or dream ##pa ##th ##s
and the interesting thing about that is that the navig ##ation and the top ##ography of regions could be dep ##icted through songs .
and for them language had infe ##ri ##or importance .
that means they navig ##ated through the use of sound and rhyth ##m .
and these sounds and this rhyth ##m dep ##icted the ge ##ology and top ##ography of a region and that of course also made it possible to def ##rag ##ment these songs and re ##arr ##ange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
at least not to navig ##ate .
what what happened there ?
what happened is the the so - called machine age .
before this , we were in the so - called age of fe ##ud ##al ##ism .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photo ##li ##th ##ography .
and what happened is that we transfer ##red the responsibility for our memories and the the production of our individual memories to ext ##ern ##al media .
to the book and to the image .
the consequence of this is that we ' ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtual ##ise .
virtual ##ity has suddenly become something alien to us
and has nothing more to do with reality .
bru ##ce brown , a famous design research ##er at bright ##on university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet etc . which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have ero ##ded our ability to virtual ##ise .
let ' s make a short prov ##ision ##al app ##ra ##isa ##l .
from the age of fe ##ud ##al ##ism to the to the machine age .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
those are the dec ##lin ##ing influence ##s of the pre - industrial cultures .
and they will they have been increasingly overw ##ritt ##en during the course of the centuries by the influence ##s of the machine age .
that means that instead of having individual memories , we have standard ##ised , wide ##spr ##e ##ad patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories .
we no longer produce .
we have an abstract an abstract ##ed language .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but cod ##ify them through language .
we ' ve got used to things happening in a linear fashion .
and we ' ve accept ##ed linear ##ity as the law and there are only except ##ions , such as non - linear ##ity .
what ' s left is storyte ##lling .
we ' re still extremely attach ##ed to storyte ##lling as a method of information broke ##rage .
the question is , what will come next ?
we had the age of fe ##ud ##al ##ism , we have had the machine age and we are now step ##ping into the so - called cyber age .
that sounds very space ##y and like science fiction , i know .
but the concepts of the cyber age , they are return ##ing these these possibilities to red ##is ##cover our ab ##ilities .
this is about virtual ##ity , about non - linear ##ity , about storyte ##lling .
i ' d like to explain that a little more .
there are technical concepts such as “ aug ##mented reality ” .
so if you think of the google glass ##es for example , then that ' s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our aff ##ini ##ty for virtual ##isation , of experien ##cing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being address ##ed again .
another example is so - called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non - existen ##t , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the hol ##ode ##ck .
and other another example are the amb ##ient , intelligent systems .
those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligent ##ly .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtual ##ity as a real living space .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final ba ##che ##lo ##r ' s projects by michael bur ##k , ann - kath ##ri ##n kre ##n ##z , jo ##ris kl ##ause and jan - mor ##itz mu ##ller .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
perhaps you could just brief ##ly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
i brought this project along as an example to illustr ##ate how these arch ##ai ##c , cognitive models are being address ##ed again .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
which of course very much accom ##mod ##ates for storyte ##lling , and it ' s a computer game .
and when i say " computer game " , you probably are imag ##ining a number of person ##s people jump ##ing around in front of some game cons ##oles or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game cons ##ole .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
this is a game for outside .
and it was express ##ly designed to enable me to discover the outside world , to red ##is ##cover the real world .
and this game connect ##s the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
i ' m sorry i have to keep this so short .
you can explain this much more el ##abor ##ately later on , as there ' s more much more to this .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned positive ##ly or negative ##ly on twitter .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impress ##ion , because i see negative and positive zone ##s of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
we can take a look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we ' re about to see .
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that ' s obvious .
using a kind of tor ##ch , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
right , i ' d like to sum ##mar ##ise my my presentation by stat ##ing that the character ##istics and ab ##ilities that we acqu ##ired during the age of fe ##ud ##al ##ism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be react ##iv ##ated with the help of the so - called cyber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products .
thank you .
yes , i ' m very happy to be here .
i was just asked whether this sac ##k is a talking sac ##k and will talk for me .
it won ' t .
i ' ll be reve ##aling what ' s inside of it in a moment .
but for now i ' ll just keep up the susp ##ens ##e .
yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers .
i ' m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity in turn transform ##s our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curiosity and need to give it a jo ##lt et ce ##ter ##a .
that ' s a whole series of things you ' re concerned with bes ##ides your existence as a designer .
when professor ##s become curious , they are often sh ##ove ##d into a research se ##me ##ster .
and that ' s happened to me these last six months .
a research se ##me ##ster on the topic natural user interface design .
now you ' ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , arch ##ai ##c prototyp ##es of communication , interaction , etc .
and now i ' ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user friendly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friendly or intuitive .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has success ##ively transformed itself from a calcul ##ator to a digital assist ##ant .
so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
why does this happen in the first place ?
so if we look at the development of our society , sum ##mar ##ised brief ##ly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
from the modern to the computer society .
each society is character ##ised by one primary medium .
in the beginning there was the trib ##al society , character ##ised by language .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca ##ve or another place together , build cities and villages and basically created this trib ##al society .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very live ##ly .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it success ##ively and relatively naturally .
that was then replace ##d by the classic ##al age and the first type of abstract ##ion .
that was a massive outc ##ry at the time , because of course it was when the live ##ly language started to manife ##st itself in writing , meaning that i took something flu ##id and alive and started to car ##ve it in stone and so manipul ##ate it .
depending on how and when i car ##ve , a very different kind of cover ##age comes into being compared to when someone express ##es it in a live ##ly form , so to speak .
but gradu ##ally the written form became the primary medium , and gain ##ed a foot ##hol ##d .
then the next generation came , which is where we ' re still prim ##arily at .
that ' s the medium of print with guten ##berg and others .
that was also an aff ##ron ##t at the time , where the gent ##ry , cle ##r ##g ##ym ##en and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they ' ll want to have something to say and that would be totally fat ##al of course .
and now we ' re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we ' re really in this in this phenomen ##al phase at the moment , the fact that we ' re experien ##cing it .
of course it totally conf ##uses us , because on the one hand we ' re seeing this new media , soc ##il social media , facebook etc .
with its complete transparency , which is the new kind of thinking that cla ##sh ##es with the old kind of thinking : don ' t say that there ' s now horse meat in the las ##agne and not bee ##f or other phenomen ##a , because i want to cover that up and not conf ##ess to it .
and these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are cla ##sh ##ing with each other at the moment .
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanism ##s , principles and arch ##ai ##c patterns of thought have been taken from from the trib ##al society .
but now it ' s not on the local level , but on the global level .
we ' ve understood that weather is global .
that the theme of ec ##ology is a global theme .
not , if i am environmental ##ly aware here on the local level and the neigh ##bo ##ur is less environmental ##ly aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intuitive as possible , but also with complete transparency .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an aff ##air with whom and when , now it ' s happening with the extens ##ion of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
we ' re accum ##ul ##ating our knowledge on a global level and we ' re accum ##ul ##ating it increasingly quick ##er and better , for example .
just like it used to happen in the village .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps forg ##otten , and what is inst ##inct ##ive for us , so what difference does it make ?
because people often come and ask , can ' t you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ?
so you have to exam ##ine what that means , and not only change it so that it ' s different , because it needs to be improve ##d too .
and to see when something is intuitive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friendly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
so even while studying , you deal with the topic of perception and perce ##pt ##ual psychology .
and of course that ' s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
and how does it look in there ?
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and what does intuitive mean and how do our channel ##s of perception work and how does cognitive processing work ?
like steve jobs once said : you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friendly or intuitive ##ly manage ##able , and what does that mean fundamentally .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven official ##ly recogn ##ised senses , and in the near future the next , the eight ##h sense will probably be added to it and as an extens ##ion of ourselves again .
and to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ?
and just to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word but don ' t know what it means in detail .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally manage ##able as possible .
and of course how design affect ##s perception .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf ##us ##ing way , as you can see here on the right , where i can ' t tell which one is salt and which one is pe ##pper , or i can basically design them intuitive ##ly , by showing things .
so a lot more naturally , and though they ' re in a contain ##er , i can directly see which one contain ##s salt and which one contain ##s pe ##pper .
and if i say to someone , pass me the salt or the pe ##pper , they ' d have to first think about what ' s in what with the right one .
with the left they ' d just intuitive ##ly grab it and then pass me the salt , as it hopefully won ' t be sugar .
but our perception , how it dec ##e ##ives us too .
for example perception in this context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn ' t at all , they ' re actually equally big , and yet our perception changes , depending on the context we place things in .
does anybody know what this is ?
come on .
pattern recogn ##ition should also work .
here here it ' s more likely to turn into my glass ##es .
so it ' s a circle .
a second circle is starting to correl ##ate or assoc ##iate a certain similar ##ity .
and if i then place a half o ##val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
this is called a law of design or gest ##alt psychology , which in turn affect ##s our perception .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
the law of pro ##x ##im ##ity , the law of of continu ##ity , etc .
they are usually forg ##otten by the third term .
but it ' s an essential component , if you want to design things as intuitive ##ly as possible .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
that might sound mund ##ane at first , but it ' s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
that ' s wrong .
first you see from back to front .
because you project an assum ##ption that you ' re seeing something you recogn ##ise to the front , such as a circle .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
i have this cognitive feedback , you project ##ed something you want to see .
and that ' s what ' s there , and comes back again .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn ' t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back and it ' s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
so it ' s a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the span of mill ##ise ##con ##ds in which these things happen .
i don ' t know if any of you know this image .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
everybody is now trying to recogn ##ise something in this pattern .
i don ' t know who recogn ##ises what .
does anyone see anything specific ?
a da ##l ##mat ##ian , exactly .
once you ' ve seen that that that you can see a da ##l ##mat ##ian in this , you know it .
you ' ll never forget it again , because i ' m showing where the da ##l ##mat ##ian is .
now you see the da ##l ##mat ##ian .
and , what ' s more , you ' ll now always see it .
that means i ' ve cor ##rupt ##ed you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i ' ve condition ##ed you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this obs ##c ##ure image .
and that ' s the project ##ion of seeing , feedback , seeing .
now i know it and project the fact that i ' m seeing a da ##l ##mat ##ian to the front .
then i see the da ##l ##mat ##ian .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place according ##ly in this , well , it ' s not really a gre ##y area , but in this rose - tin ##ted area .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
a long time , yes .
that ' s our present .
so it ' s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of br ##id ##ging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occup ##ied for three seconds .
he will have to process that as the present .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very ele ##gant way , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes twenty - five mill ##ise ##con ##ds ?
yes , mill ##ise ##con ##ds .
another very exciting phenomenon .
it ' s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
and six ##te ##en mill ##ise ##con ##ds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that ' s the period of time it takes to form most perception ##s we have .
that means the first impress ##ion comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we perce ##ive things .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it according ##ly .
of course designers don ' t only look at the topic of perception ##s and neur ##al processes or cognitive erg ##onom ##ics , but prim ##arily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
on the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language , so formal aspect ##s or formal a ##est ##het ##ic aspect ##s .
there are indic ##ator functions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
but there are also symbol ##ic functions ; why does someone spend such horr ##end ##ous sum ##s of money on such a little bag that you can hard ##ly fit anything into , even when it ' s not very practical ?
we ' re more on the symbol ##ic , on the se ##man ##t ##ic level there , something we designers are also pre ##oc ##c ##up ##ied with .
going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that ' s behind that is usa ##bil ##ity of course .
usa ##bil ##ity always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satisf ##ying way possible .
that ' s what the norm says .
how can i make something as user friendly as possible ?
can i handle it directly or do i need a man ##ual or a corresp ##ond ##ent training .
and then it ' s less usa ##ble or user friendly .
making it differently or pret ##t ##ier doesn ' t mean it ' s easier to use .
that ' s something we have to understand .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you ' ll understand why nine ##ty - nine percent of today ' s software is less intuitive or not inst ##anta ##ne ##ously usa ##ble , including the ip ##ad in many areas or the iphone , although it ' s already a lot more intuitive than classic ##al software .
intuitive usa ##bil ##ity didn ' t start to become an element ##ary economic factor , an element ##ary success factor , when apple appear ##ed on the scene , if i wanted to make technological devices usa ##ble for people .
why ?
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of usa ##bil ##ity , so natural user interface ##s .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classic ##al software and take five hours to do it , then you ' d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
that probably doesn ' t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your employe ##r or who ##ever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course according ##ly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first command line interface ##s , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to handle these systems .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neur ##al model or mental model , as software erg ##onom ##ists say , because you ' d have a concept ##ion of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a desk ##to ##p , to make the computer usa ##ble .
so no more zero ##s and ones with cry ##pt ##ic code ##s , but a metaphor .
that made the whole thing consider ##ably more user friendly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
the next generation of graph ##ic user interface ##s already works with behav ##io ##ur a lot more .
so , as a designer , i design behav ##io ##ur much more much more often than appear ##ance .
that ' s also a paradigm shift .
that i can suddenly that the appear ##ance is becoming increasingly irre ##le ##vant for success , and usa ##bil ##ity is becoming an application .
and if i go a step further in these natural user interface ##s , where i can control things vi ##a voice , speech , touch and gest ##ure rather than a mouse and cur ##so ##r , then i am even faster and more immed ##iate .
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intuitive ?
if they become more intuitive and then i have to rough - handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive erg ##onom ##ics , when is something really intuitive ?
and that ' s for us humans , something is intuitive when there ' s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
so appar ##ently humans don ' t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
it means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
that means i can transfer an intuitive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software consider ##ably more user friendly .
that pos ##es the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance sche ##me that we humans have and now i ' ve already given it away .
it ' s the so - called os ##it model .
we all use it , and os ##it is an ac ##ron ##ym that stands for orient , sele ##ct , inform , trans ##act .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you ' re doing it unc ##ons ##cious ##ly and , well , pretty intuitive ##ly and also inst ##inct ##ively in part .
the model already takes shape while you ' re still in your mother ' s wom ##b and it ' s inter ##cul ##t ##ural , so it functions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
os ##it in itself is used by us fif ##ty to seven ##ty thousand times depending on the activity , it was as ##cer ##t ##ained that when you sleep it is stra ##ined less than in the day .
i can transfer this performance model orient , sele ##ct , inform , trans ##act to an interaction system .
and this kind of transfer ##al , much like the metaphor of the desk ##to ##p , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
and that ' s on a higher gra ##il of user friend ##lines ##s than the transfer ##al of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the desk ##to ##p .
and if i now transfer this , if i let orient take shape as an over ##v ##iew , sele ##ct as a selection , inform in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , trans ##act means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shop ##ping , etc . ,
and then i can transfer the whole thing .
i ' ll try to do that using an example .
everybody was having some ca ##ke earlier .
over ##v ##iew : i ' m interact ##ing with the object so to speak , can zoom back out , zoom in .
i get the entire over ##v ##iew , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with chocolate , for example .
and suddenly i have an interface that is consider ##ably more intuitive and natural .
because the fact that i can grab hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is consider ##ably more natural than when i am able to make these things accessible vi ##a hierarch ##ically organis ##ed website ##s or other mechanism ##s so to speak .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i ' d like to close on that sentence a and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arr ##ive at new solutions , and so i thank you warm ##ly for your attention and please .
i ' d like to rein ##tr ##od ##uc ##e you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
first ##ly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of exc ##ret ##ions you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your pot ##ty and stir its content ##s , your curiosity is of course aw ##ake ##ne ##d .
and curiosity can ' t be learned .
that ' s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a character ##istic that can ' t be learned .
my object ##ive is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , fort ##y years of the - club - of - rom ##e , into quality .
and there ' s one central point here .
and that has to do with phosphor ##us .
give pe ##e a chance .
every day you release + you release in the region of two gra ##ms of phosphor ##us and every day you have to absorb two gra ##ms of phosphor ##us .
otherwise you couldn ' t have teeth .
and you wouldn ' t be able to save energy .
you wouldn ' t be able to have bones .
we ' d only be able to flo ##at in the earth ' s seas as am ##or ##ph ##ous mo ##ll ##us ##c ##s .
if , in fact , we couldn ' t absorb and release phosphor ##us .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn ' t at all .
because everybody ' s talking about energy , but nobody ' s talking about the phosphor ##us problem .
the phosphor ##us problem is much more critical .
we are depend ##ent on two countries .
we only have phosphor ##us for two years and phosphor ##us mini ##ng worldwide is already em ##itting a lot more ur ##ani ##um into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
in the last twenty years alone , fif ##te ##en thousand ton ##nes of ur ##ani ##um was put onto our fields in germany .
and we absorb all of it .
it causes le ##uk ##em ##ia in children .
and we think we ' re protect ##ing the environment when we do a little less damage .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
protect the environment , produce less rub ##bi ##sh .
protect the environment , consum ##e less energy .
but that ' s not protection .
that ' s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
it ' s just a little less destruction .
if that ' s our thinking from from the cra ##dle to the grav ##e , then our our entire planet will become a ce ##met ##ery soon ##er or later .
that ' s why we need to think from cra ##dle to cra ##dle .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
the ground store ##s over six ##ty percent of the planet ' s carbon .
at the moment we ' re growing corn and losing between elev ##en and thir ##ty kil ##ogra ##ms thir ##ty ton ##nes per he ##ct ##are , if you were to calcul ##ate it per square met ##re .
that means we ' re losing five - thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
and everything is either the pack ##aging or the content ##s .
in offen ##ba ##ch , for example , twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by house ##hol ##ds cons ##ists of na ##pp ##ies .
and as we get older , the na ##pp ##ies get bigger .
+ that is they ' re all in the pre - na ##ppy stage , so to speak .
right ?
one a baby needs about six - thousand na ##pp ##ies .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
china can make up for that in one second .
it ' s entirely ins ##ign ##ific ##ant .
so the question is , how should we deal with na ##pp ##ies ?
here we have a the pro ##of , by the way , that humans are not pig ##s .
i ' d like to tell you why .
because with pig ##s , phosphor ##us is released in their solid components fa ##ec ##es .
with people , it is released in the ur ##ine .
yes .
so humans can ' t be pig ##s .
that prove ##s it , doesn ' t it ?
traditional ##ly , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
and if you den ##y people the if you den ##y people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren ' t here at all , people become grab ##by and host ##ile .
and so you have someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , saying : there is nothing more important than stabil ##ising the human population .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you ' re saving the world .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants weigh four times as much a people .
i could also mention term ##ites , but in the usa nobody like ##s term ##ites , although they ' re veget ##arian ##s .
so ants weigh more than we do .
and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thir ##ty billion people .
that means there are not too many of us , we ' re just too stupid , you see ?
and when you see how far remove ##d we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offen ##ba ##ch , for example , has a program to be climate neutral by twenty fort ##y , right ?
you can only be climate neutral if you don ' t exist , you see ?
that ' s your only chance .
have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ?
have you ?
just one single one ?
that means our entire intelligence amounts to us want ##ing to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
you see ?
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral .
thank ##fully , right ?
there ' s no problem with over ##po ##p ##ulation among trees .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon forest alone .
of those have you ever heard of over ##po ##p ##ulation of trees ?
so all of our intelligence amounts to us want ##ing to be dum ##ber than trees .
and then you see that even something like dem ##eter , the str ##ict ##est organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn ' t allow for our own metabol ##ic waste to be return ##ed .
every year we lose about three ton ##nes of phosphor ##us , which should really be circ ##ulate ##d .
and so there are too many of us .
just because of that .
that means we feel so gu ##ilt ##y on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no biol ##and , no nature - et - progr ##es or whatever they ' re all called , that per ##mit ##s our own exc ##re ##ment to be put back into the cycle .
isn ' t that sad ?
and that means there are too many of us .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
but where are we of use ?
we try to minim ##ize our ec ##ological footprint , but the point is to have a big footprint that ' s of use .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon ##our ##able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
zero emissions , you see ?
you can only have zero emissions if you don ' t exist .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you ' d still have emissions .
so you can ' t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can win back our nutr ##ients .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutr ##ients .
this is a very direct way to get back nutr ##ients in agriculture .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
in in china a a cha ##m ##ber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutr ##ients .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is character ##ized by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutr ##ients from increasingly distance places .
that ' s why all western emp ##ires just kept on expand ##ing until they couldn ' t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they impl ##ode ##d .
you see ?
it was different in china .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutr ##ients .
even today , if you get invited to dinner in china , people expect you to stay on after the me ##al until you need to use the toile ##t .
because it ' s unf ##rie ##nd ##ly to go and take the nutr ##ients with you .
you were you were invited to dinner , not to ste ##al nutr ##ients .
that means you can see how to win back nutr ##ients on the internet .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bio ##gas , on one he ##ct ##are of land with five thousand in ##hab ##ita ##nt ##s in the fa ##vel ##as , a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maint ##ain the plot with it , raise chicken ##s and pig ##s and du ##cks and grow veget ##ables and farm fish .
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa ##vel ##as goes down by over nine ##ty percent .
so we don ' t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
that ' s high - tech agriculture of course , but the plot ##s take care of themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they ' re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
and none of these plot ##s , and we ' ve built over one hundred fif ##ty of them in the last twenty years , none of these plot ##s was every sa ##bot ##aged .
it would be easy to just throw a lit ##re of waste oil onto it and the plot would be ru ##ined for years .
that doesn ' t happen .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
we can support them in doing good .
so we must get the phosphor ##us back .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in germany the most suit ##able pur ##ification plant is the one in frank ##f ##urt .
unfortunately not the one on offen ##ba ##ch , but perhaps you can give the frank ##f ##urt ##ers a hand .
because the plant in frank ##f ##urt would be the best at win ##ning back phosphor ##us .
and it must go back .
we can see that phosphor ##us is really critical .
and we can see that it can be done .
in hol ##land we ' ve been working on this for over three years now .
the dut ##ch government has state ##d that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosphor ##us .
but we need this everywhere .
you see , there are two countries that control almost seven ##ty percent of the phosphor ##us reser ##vo ##ir ##s worldwide .
there ' s the op ##ec , a a bunch of amate ##urs .
it cons ##ists of twenty - six member countries that control fort ##y percent of all the oil dep ##os ##its .
and oil will be able to be replace ##d by other energy sources .
but phosphor ##us will not be able to be replace ##d .
that ' s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
and it ' s the first question to ask is what is right .
so it ' s about effect ##ivity , not efficiency .
in hol ##land it ' s easier to understand this , because hol ##land built the country on flowers .
you see ?
imagine your your wife is sad , because you up ##set her , and you turn up with fif ##ty rose ##s .
totally ine ##ffic ##ient .
but totally effective , right ?
or take li ##ps ##t ##ick .
a woman in germany sw ##allow ##s about six point three kil ##os of li ##ps ##t ##ick in her lifetime .
whereas .
and that scientific ##ally speaking , that ' s not not exactly correct , because because we don ' t know how much is k ##issed away .
but i can tell you , even in this light , that li ##ps ##t ##ick is totally ine ##ffic ##ient , but very effective , you see ?
a all the beautiful things in life are ine ##ffic ##ient .
so that ' s why we ' re not talking about resource efficiency , but effect ##ivity .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
not burning the bio ##so ##li ##ds a little more , stor ##ing them and losing all the materials for the cycle ##s in the inc ##ine ##ration plant , but asking ones ##el ##f , how do you close cycle ##s ?
imagine mo ##z ##art being efficient .
right ?
if i inv ##ite you over for dinner and i say : yes , we ' re having a pill with offen ##ba ##ch taste and a glass of water to go with it .
wonderful , right ?
that ' s efficient .
everything that ' s nice in life is not efficient .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
yes ?
that means that everything that count ##s in life is not about saving , avoid ##ing , redu ##cing .
the whole environmental discussion .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environmental ##ly aware .
no , throw ##ing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
to what we ' re thinking from a northern perspective .
every footprint is dis ##ad ##vant ##age ##ous there .
when you go running , right , every footprint destroy ##s the ground .
because the soil will the mos ##s dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil .
but if you ' re in it ##aly , every footprint means the water will remain in the field for longer .
so it ' s about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into we ##t ##land .
not gu ##ilt management .
we say sustainability in germany .
right ?
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
what would you say ?
sustainable .
then i would say , my warm cond ##ole ##n ##ces , you see ?
that ' s just about the minim ##um .
so not saving , abs ##t ##aining from , avoid ##ing .
every bit of waste is a nutr ##ient .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in it ##aly throw out a can of coca - cola from their car window .
that ' s a funny occur ##ren ##ce , you know .
it ' s a type of terr ##itor ##ial behavior , right ?
you can show that you were there .
but with the right design , please .
we ' ve designed an ice cre ##am wra ##pping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
in two hours it ' s biod ##e ##grad ##ed , wherever it is .
and it contain ##s seed ##s of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you ' re contrib ##uting to biod ##ivers ##ity .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harm ##ful .
so two cycle ##s are created .
of course not everything should be comp ##ost ##able .
a tv or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don ' t exp ##end them .
only things that are subject to wear and tea ##r , such as sh ##oe sol ##es , bra ##ke cover ##ings , car ty ##res , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
but today we ' re just talking about biological systems .
right ?
let ' s take sn ##e ##akers for example , right ?
direct advertising , and not necessarily for the company pum ##a , but to help this company make these products successful .
because we don ' t we no longer make things free of stuff .
right ?
so if i inv ##ite you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn ' t help you at all .
no , we define what ' s inside .
positive ##ly .
so not like a det ##ox .
there ' s nothing po ##ison ##ous in it .
everything that ' s inside can be ut ##il ##ized .
these are the first shoes with which you make a jack ##rab ##bit start at the ped ##est ##ria ##n lights and the rub ##ber sol ##e can go into biological cycle ##s , okay ?
it ' s all comp ##ost ##able all of it .
and if we manage to do it , we ' ll of course manage to do it for ad ##ida ##s , for n ##ike , for hen ##nes and ma ##ur ##itz and the whole text ##ile industry .
and half of the waste ##water problem worldwide is caused by the text ##ile industry .
so you ' re helping out there , just ask the people .
hey , pum ##a , do you are you really serious ?
because they changed their chair ##man of the board of director ##s twice now .
and i ' m not so sure they ' re going to stick with it .
so give me a hand here .
it is possible though .
yes .
that which i just presented to you .
it ' s possible .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and tea ##r , when they break , they can go into biological life cycle ##s .
there are also technical cycle ##s .
there ' s the a direct return ##ing system for this .
it ' s the first biological ru ##cks ##ack , truly , that was made to be return ##ed into the life cycle .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
if you think about it , right ?
remember those na ##pp ##ies again ?
if at the moment they ' re waste .
these na ##pp ##ies are everywhere practical ##ly .
in those countries where people have money .
they ' re on the rub ##bi ##sh t ##ips , but also else ##where in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water tank , inside , so they can go back to a cell ##ul ##ose base , you ' ll be able to plant one hundred and fif ##ty trees in israel or tun ##is ##ia with one baby .
right ?
if you just take these these na ##pp ##ies , shr ##ed them , ster ##il ##ize them and take the pow ##der to plant trees with it .
that makes the baby carbon - positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
so we don ' t need to be climate neutral , we can be climate - positive .
it ' s about making a benef ##ic ##ial po ##op print .
yes , so to speak .
right ?
we can do that .
we can re - invent things all over again .
i found ##ed an institute with this in mind .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
there ' s also an extra assoc ##iation , the cra ##dle - to - cra ##dle - institute , where everybody can get involved .
so no more saving , abs ##t ##aining from , avoid ##ing , redu ##cing , no more gu ##ilt management , but intelligent waste .
does that make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpret ##er .
music as language .
in the descri ##ption of my presentation , it is written that i , as an interpret ##er , see myself as a transl ##ator , in the english sense of the word .
interpret ##ers are transl ##ators of the written notes in res ##ound ##ing music .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a transl ##ator can ' t just simply ren ##der a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful transl ##ation can occur .
transl ##ating from german into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it ' s the transl ##ation of literature or even poetry .
what we music ##ians do with our musical language is very alien to non - professional ##s .
as an interpret ##er of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .
now you probably think that the comp ##ose ##r , when writing down the notes , already include ##s everything they ' ve thought of .
in reality the notes are very vag ##ue and impr ##ec ##ise .
these notes are about as precise or impr ##ec ##ise as the verb ##al descri ##ption of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely precise .
because you can ' t smell the flowers in the verb ##al descri ##ption of a landscape , you can ' t guess the shad ##e of green , you can ' t hear or feel the wh ##is ##per ##ing of the wind .
this means that the interpret ##er must translate these impr ##ec ##ise indic ##ations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an aud ##ible , concrete , non - verb ##al musical language .
today i ' d like to verb ##ally translate what i usually translate into music , or interpret .
so you could call it the transl ##ation of a transl ##ation .
that ' s why i prefer to do it all in german , because if i ' d have to translate it into english , that would be like the transl ##ation of the transl ##ation of the transl ##ation .
the so , music functions a lot like spoken language in my opinion .
the ann ##ota ##ted notes have the function of the letters of a language .
so it ' s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according key ##s on the piano or the right position on a viol ##in string .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
you don ' t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language .
there are different grade ##s here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it pass ##ively or whether you can also active ##ly speak it , all the way to the musical nat ##ive speak ##er .
the work of the interpret ##er starts off much like the work of a the ##at ##re director .
once you ' ve sele ##cted a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the comp ##osition ' s creation .
you collect information about the piece in second ##ary literature .
you read letters , di ##aries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were express ##ed by the comp ##ose ##r themselves .
you study works that have been comp ##osed before or after .
you make compar ##ison ##s .
the reasons for writing it .
how and what did they feel ?
what were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
all that interests me .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading literature from that period .
after a while , you already have a vast reser ##vo ##ir of knowledge surround ##ing the comp ##ose ##r as an interpret ##er , and you listen to them regular ##ly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the comp ##ose ##r .
the comp ##ose ##r increasingly becomes like a friend you ' re living with .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
as the note is anything but a precise indic ##ation of the desire of a comp ##ose ##r , and is , rather , a framework , i will now ut ##il ##ise this framework to fill it with sense and meaning .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework .
i play to explain what these ton ##es might have meant .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the comp ##ose ##r at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
every note , every phrase is th ##us given a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from what i ' ve personally experienced .
it has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise i won ' t convince my audience that this is my desire .
it always makes for a happy concert when i have the fortune to experience the piece an ##e ##w , even though i ' ve been working on it for so long in adv ##ance .
it ' s like experien ##cing a happy new day afr ##esh , even though you go through the same ritual ##s , getting up , having break ##f ##ast , going to work , i experience the same piece an ##e ##w again and again .
i ' m a day older , the season ##s change , my pu ##ls ##e is slow ##er in the evening than it is in the morning , in a concert hall it takes longer for the reve ##r ##ber ##ation to return than it does at home .
i ' m aware of the breathing of the audience , conscious ##ly or unc ##ons ##cious ##ly .
all this influence ##s me and influence ##s my experience of the comp ##osition .
it ' s also really wonderful when i ' m on stage with my musical other half and we ' re on the same wave ##len ##gth .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimul ##ating conversation .
you introduce a new idea and this is answer ##ed inst ##anta ##ne ##ously with a reaction .
it ' s exciting , because things happen that we didn ' t practice and we aren ' t able to practice .
it ' s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communicate ##s in a live ##ly way .
in this way , every concert is a different concert .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
i won ' t be able to play like i do today in twenty years .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical pale ##tte will have many more nu ##ances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
sure , i will have throw ##n some colors away too , but i will have added new ones to take their place .
i have a nice , concrete example to illustr ##ate this .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my belo ##ved old teacher professor jur ##gen u ##de , a well - known beet ##ho ##ven special ##ist , concert pian ##ist and long ##stand ##ing professor at the conserv ##atory here in stu ##tt ##gar ##t .
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already ret ##ired before i finally started studying .
but i had the good fortune to meet him at a very young age , when i was thir ##te ##en , and so i always att ##ende ##d his course ##s while i was at school .
i was seven ##te ##en when i took part in a course of his and played the last of chop ##in ' s four ball ##ads , one of his later works .
he asked me what the pre ##amb ##le to this ball ##ad was in my opinion .
it ' s a sol ##em ##n part .
and , being young , i said , expect ##ation .
he smile ##d and said , oh ?
that must be our difference in age .
because to me it means memory .
he was over six ##ty at the time .
well , at seven ##te ##en you still have dreams , but no significant memories .
today , i play this piece every few years and it ' s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
it ' s exciting every time , because i read something new in it every time .
another example from a very different field . mon ##et paint ##ed his water ##li ##lie ##s an infinite number of times .
it ' s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
he translate ##d the water ##li ##lie ##s differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
his personal impress ##ions of the water ##li ##lie ##s .
a piece of music that is interpret ##ed for the um ##pte ##enth time is compar ##able in this way .
now i am also older than chop ##in when he wrote the piece at thir ##ty - two .
he only lived until the age of thir ##ty - nine .
and it ' s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
to maint ##ain the dialog ##ue , directly with the comp ##ose ##r .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
especially if he ' s already dead .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spoken language .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
you practical ##ly first learn to read before you speak an a word .
you learn to find the ton ##es on the instrument that go with the notes .
when you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then ton ##es come out , which , together , sound like music .
once it ' s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
beginn ##ers ' classes hard ##ly talk about interpretation .
well , so it says pres ##to at the top , so that ' s a fast piece .
len ##to , slow .
the loud and soft symbol ##s , f and b , etc ##eter ##a .
most people here have heard of them .
but even if you impl ##ement these indic ##ations , it still just remains something technical .
and it still isn ' t an interpretation .
i ' m surprised .
i ' m surprised that people often forget something very element ##ary .
which is that to make music on an instrument one ' s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in adv ##ance .
which is singing .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own .
it ' s like learning to speak .
it ' s necessary to have one ' s own experiences and idea of music to then make it reson ##ate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
people who have never sun ##g consequen ##t ##ly never directly felt with their own body what it ' s like to create a ton ##e .
to form a phrase with one ' s own breath .
the music instrument is an extens ##ion of our own body .
we use our voc ##al cho ##r ##ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham ##mer ##head ##s in the piano are the extens ##ions of my fingers .
the mel ##ody is created through what ' s being sun ##g and rhyth ##m is created through dance .
the constant flo ##od ##ing of music today is not very benef ##ic ##ial there .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you ' re bor ##ed .
you no longer need to whist ##le or sing a song .
all one ' s own music is destroy ##ed because you ' re constantly being bomb ##ard ##ed by music from outside of yourself .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can ' t sing ?
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can ' t sing ?
or b , because you didn ' t learn how to sing ?
in both cases , it ' s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to properly use these little muscle ##s that att ##une the voc ##al cho ##r ##ds .
because you can train that .
or c , because you were told that you aren ' t suit ##able .
then my question is , how professional ##ly compet ##ent was this diagn ##osis ?
did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so nice ##ly now ##ada ##ys ?
or d , you simply don ' t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
which i would very much reg ##ret , because music is a lovely , communic ##ative thing .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hope ##less candid ##ate .
but please don ' t say , i don ' t understand a thing about classic ##al music .
i can ' t say whether it ' s good or bad .
then my answer is , but i ' m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
because i don ' t think anyone will say , i don ' t know whether i like the taste , because i can ' t cook .
so , you don ' t abs ##t ##ain from food just because you can ' t cook .
so you don ' t need to abs ##t ##ain from listening to classic ##al music because you don ' t play an instrument .
listen conscious ##ly and say whether you like its taste or not .
whether the music is too pe ##pper ##y or sweet for your taste .
say what you feel .
with time , you will have demand ##s and will want to have more sp ##ices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen active ##ly ?
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
a work of art that is never looked at will never gather the strength to have an effect .
one should eat the food that is lo ##ving ##ly cook ##ed by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the rec ##ipe for it .
so please listen when music is played .
it is not only a nice wall ##pa ##per made of noise .
when a child grows up in an environment where the adults active ##ly make music or at least active ##ly listen ##s to music , it ' s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
and it will sound completely different from before .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was original ##ly written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
instruments have developed .
there was no key ##board instrument such as the piano in ba ##ch ' s time .
it just hadn ' t been invented .
i think ba ##ch would have been very enthus ##ias ##t ##ic if he ' d had the ton ##al possibilities that today ' s modern piano ##s have .
i can make ba ##ch ' s ton ##al ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a bar ##o ##que har ##ps ##ich ##ord was not able to .
of beet ##ho ##ven we know that he listen ##ed more once he ' d already gone de ##af .
today a modern orche ##stra can play anything that was re ##jected as un ##pl ##ay ##able at the time .
that ' s why comp ##ose ##r ##s depend on us interpret ##ers to rein ##vent the pieces again and again .
so that what they had only con ##j ##ured up in their minds becomes listen ##able .
and also anything they would con ##j ##ure up in their minds today .
or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what en ##v ##y is ?
were you ever en ##vious ?
and how did you feel ?
terrible .
i have a friend who drives a pass ##era ##t ##i .
when i turn up in my little v ##w cl ##unk ##er and park next to it , i get this feeling .
something shoot ##s through my head .
i say , u ##l ##f , why do you need such a big car ?
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
and then it comes to me straight away , it ' s unf ##air .
it goes against justice .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappear ##s .
our organism has come up with an exc ##ellen ##t method to make un ##ple ##asa ##nt feelings like en ##v ##y simply disappear .
you can also try it with words like reven ##ge or acqu ##is ##itive ##ness and the like .
i would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you ' re probably quite familiar with it on an unc ##ons ##cious level .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don ' t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any intention of building a wall .
and then they start pil ##ing up stone ##s so your view is block ##ed .
a lie like that shows you that the li ##ar himself doesn ' t believe what he says .
and it ' s easily prove ##n that he has something entirely different in mind .
he ' s only dec ##e ##iving you and not himself .
no , the lie i ' m talking about is one where you ' re dec ##e ##iving yourself .
you need this lie to keep this sh ##am , this self - dec ##ep ##t ##ion , up ##right .
this is harder to check or bring down .
you need time .
an an ##ecd ##ote you might know talks about this time .
the span ##ish paint ##er pa ##bl ##o p ##ica ##ss ##o once paint ##ed a portrait of a woman .
the woman then compl ##ained that the portrait didn ' t look anything like her .
p ##ica ##ss ##o ' s answer , just wait and see .
it will start to look more and more like you .
at this point and if you ' re laugh ##ing , you ' ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
because artists have a dist ##orted relationship to the lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can ' t see if she just looks in the mirror .
the artist is conv ##e ##ying something you can only get to know once you ' ve looked at the work of art again and again .
then that un ##ple ##asa ##nt feeling that it couldn ' t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
here you have this mechanism , with which we can use the lie as a grand ##ios ##e invention to stabil ##ize our living conditions .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol ##kt ##ales , fol ##kt ##ales , in in myth ##ology , in stories .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at herself in the mirror every day and said , who is the fair ##est of them all ?
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fair ##er than you .
over the hill ##s and all that .
and you also know how much host ##ility ar ##ises from this piece of truth , for the mirror can ' t lie , from this piece of truth .
but we should just realize that you can ' t tell a woman that there ' s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
it ' s necessary to always use what you would call political correct ##ness here .
we need this lie here , to keep the dec ##ep ##t ##ion up ##right , without which we wouldn ' t be able to go on living .
we don ' t only have such amazing lies in art and fol ##kt ##ales , but also in science .
and here there ' s this story about the wife of the bis ##ho ##p of wor ##ces ##ter .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the desc ##ent of man .
that humans are supposed to have desc ##ende ##d from ap ##es and that , yes , there is at least one ancest ##or shared by both humans and ap ##es .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what charles has written is not true .
that the human desc ##ende ##d from ap ##es and we have a shared ancest ##or .
no , no , that ' s not possible .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
because we can ' t live our lives without this lie .
because we want this self - dec ##ep ##t ##ion , this feeling of being brilliant , desc ##ende ##d from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as un ##pre ##di ##ct ##able as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that ' s unbe ##ara ##ble for us .
so we can ' t bear these things .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they ' re true .
to show you how slowly this mechanism disappear ##s and to illustr ##ate the tra ##ces it leaves , which lead to something other than this grand ##ios ##e image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
my wife told me it .
one day she came back from her school , she ' s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pu ##p ##ils .
an aut ##istic pu ##p ##il .
she like ##s him a lot , because he has the tenden ##cy to be forth ##right .
and she asked him , so what are your hob ##bie ##s ?
and then he said , well , i ' m with the fire br ##ig ##ade .
and because i ' m with the fire br ##ig ##ade , i ' m interested in py ##rote ##chn ##ical things .
yes , you ' ll sense it if you ' re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to moral ##ly just ##ify something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
you do this and then you ' ll see the sentence , although i ' m with the fire br ##ig ##ade , i ' m interested in py ##rote ##chn ##ical things .
you sense that that ‘ s the actual truth behind the sentence .
a young lad like that , he ' s not interested in putting out fire ##s .
he ' s interested in setting fire ##s .
but there are no assoc ##iation ##s to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
there ' s only the second best option , which is the fire br ##ig ##ade .
that ' s where he sign ##ed up .
and more ##over , you don ' t tell your teacher that you like to set fire ##s and are happy when the fire fl ##are ##s up .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we ' re responsible for remo ##ving the danger that others create when they set a fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this this hin ##t at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can ' t say that out loud .
here you have the cens ##or between the unc ##ons ##cious and the conscious , which switch ##es on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correct ##ness .
we know that something else is really true .
but we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitive ##ly dist ##ur ##bed .
we can ' t just do that .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
i ' d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
according to which logic do we diss ##em ##ina ##te this dec ##ep ##t ##ion , this self - dec ##ep ##t ##ion , this willing ##ness to present a reality that ' s different from the reality we know is val ##id in our unc ##ons ##cious minds ?
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illustr ##ate this .
the first example works with the pres ##ump ##t ##ion of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don ' t need at all .
i ' m talking about the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something mental , le ##ib ##n ##iz said .
it does not have a ta ##ng ##ible , material nature .
and when you are with people who are firm ##ly convinced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an inc ##or ##por ##e ##al framework around you , and it ' s not material , and you are just made of fle ##sh and blood , are solid , so to speak , bound to the earth , ep ##hem ##era ##l , subject to dec ##ay , ins ##ign ##ific ##ant , dead really .
and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an air ##y nature , it ' s called anim ##a in lat ##in , being like a breath of air .
and when this breath of air pour ##s out onto a human , the human is filled with dign ##ity , with mind , with nature that can only live with a soul .
and then it can leave you .
that ' s how people imagine the soul works .
that it comes to the human from outside .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
and if you think of this condition , then you ' ll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
because now you can impl ##ement a rule of three .
you ' ll remember the rule of three from school .
this is a rule of three , which describe ##s a logic to us .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
you ' ll need some logic here , but also the willing ##ness to lie .
name ##ly to lie in such a way that you can simply impl ##ement this logic in the wrong way .
this rule of three contain ##s three theor ##em ##s .
the first theor ##em is , kl ##aus claim ##s there is no soul .
the second theor ##em is th ##us , if kl ##aus is right , then he doesn ' t have a soul .
now we have the third theor ##em .
i highl ##ight ##ed it here .
a third theor ##em which will turn up in people who have a strong attach ##ment to the idea of a soul .
they will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can ' t claim anything .
so you sense it already .
here this logic is express ##ed in this dec ##ep ##t ##ive disc ##our ##se .
you see it straight away .
the first two theor ##em ##s are logic ##ally correct .
i can claim anything .
logic does not make any statement ##s about reality .
i can say , the german chance ##ll ##or is a man .
and if i ' m right , then the chance ##ll ##or is a man .
if i ' m not right , then the chance ##ll ##or is not a man .
logic does not make any statement about what is val ##id .
i can claim anything .
what is dec ##is ##ive , if i ' m right , then it ' s val ##id .
so when kl ##aus says , there is no soul .
second ##ly , if he ' s right , then he doesn ' t have a soul .
these things are logic ##ally correct .
and now our dec ##ep ##t ##ive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
so it attach ##es a third theor ##em to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theor ##em ##s and only acts as if the opposite of the first theor ##em had already been prove ##n and given prior ##ity .
because we ' d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not .
but with this logic , which just uses the fact that two theor ##em ##s are logic ##ally correct and attach ##es a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul .
and we ' re very happy about it .
we can apply these things to other examples .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repe ##ated ##ly an it ##em in the daily newspaper ##s .
here you have to keep another philosoph ##ical theme , a philosoph ##ical slow - burn ##er , close to hand .
that has to do with us going back to the four ##te ##enth
century .
there was a scho ##la ##r called je ##an bur ##ida ##n , and bur ##ida ##n ' s ass was named after him .
bur ##ida ##n ' s ass is an ass that is made pure ##ly of nature .
it doesn ' t have this soul .
it ' s a natural thing .
and if you put it exactly between two equally big ha ##ys ##t ##ack ##s , it will star ##ve .
because it doesn ' t know which ha ##ys ##t ##ack it should go to first .
so it ' s right in the middle .
that ' s how things of nature are imagine ##d .
two equally large forces with opposite signs ##na ##t ##ures will can ##cel each other out .
nothing will happen .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha ##ys ##t ##ack bigger than the other , then he doesn ' t need any sense or anything else .
he ' ll automatically go to the right thought .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determine ##d by the larger ha ##ys ##t ##ack that immediately attract ##s you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and as we ' re here in frank ##f ##urt am main , i ' ll remind you of the max - plan ##ck - institute for brain research .
there ' s a scho ##la ##r there , his name is wol ##f sing ##er , and sometimes people say , wol ##f sing ##er claim ##s , there is no free will .
now we can come up with the second theor ##em and say : if wol ##f sing ##er is right , then he has no free will .
these theor ##em ##s are absolutely logic ##al and correct .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theor ##em .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claim ##s and is th ##us of uns ##ound mind .
here you have it again .
really , you ' d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
but the logic of dec ##ep ##t ##ion allows us to act as if the first theor ##em were false from the start , so of course you ' d have accept the opposite without any pro ##of .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predict ##ors .
and don ' t use the german word for predict ##ors , which would be prop ##het .
you must ##n ' t say that , because that would be a little political ##ly inc ##or ##re ##ct .
say , there are no predict ##ors .
you ' ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it ' s a matter of course that there are predict ##ors , you can ' t prove that .
and you ' ll have a problem right away .
because while you are busy telling yourself that you can ' t prove that there are no predict ##ors , your counter ##part will be very happy .
he ' ll be very happy because he ' s dec ##e ##ived you .
because he led you down a path he ' s not on himself .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
he ' s only interested in keeping himself free of the necess ##ity to prove that there are predict ##ors .
so through this mode of pass ##ing on the bur ##den of prov ##ing something you are experien ##cing the brill ##ian ##ce of the lie .
and if you have another opportunity to en ##act this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don ' t remind them of their self - dec ##ep ##t ##ion .
thank you for your attention .
yes , hello .
i took the liber ##ty i asked li ##lly , if it would be okay to mention her .
she ' s one of the organ ##izer ##s of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea .
i must honest ##ly say , and you witness ##ed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
but of course it ' s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
i probably belong , are those two friendly girls still here , i probably belong to the generation that created this bad ec ##ological image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar ##ls ##ruh ##e in nine ##te ##en seven ##ty nine , i think it ' s called kit today .
and then i went to berlin in the mid - eight ##ies because i wanted to study renew ##able energie ##s and they didn ' t have that in kar ##ls ##ruh ##e .
there was the le ##opol ##ds ##ha ##fen nuclear research plant .
they were all called k ##f ##as at the time , the place in jul ##ich was also called a k ##f ##a .
today they ' re called project exec ##uting organizations .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
but something stupid like a solar pen ##du ##lu ##m , which has an output of something like one hundred watt per square met ##re , that was a toy .
and in berlin there was this crazy engineering collective .
i ' m grat ##ef ##ul to the person behind prem ##ium cola that he re ##hab ##il ##ita ##ted that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything left - wing was bad .
but it wasn ' t like that in the eight ##ies .
at that time , there were self - govern ##ing companies and one of them was in kreuz ##berg in mehr ##ing ##hof , where people thought evil took place .
a terror ##ist place , but it was was called wus ##elt ##ron ##ik and it made wind and solar power and that ' s where i started out in the mid - eight ##ies .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice statement ##s were made , which i also was part of .
i worked in the collective for elev ##en years , it was based on a grass ##ro ##ots democracy .
we were a group of twenty people .
if one person said no , there was the ve ##to principle , which was totally dem ##ora ##li ##s ##ing , for ten years , i i had grav ##e doubt ##s as to whether i was perhaps really was ##ting my great engineering degree on something ridic ##ulous , also because all my father ' s colleagues had told him , you waste ##d your money on your child .
he ' s was ##ting his time on non ##sens ##e .
and that was really very , very bitte ##r and then you end up in one of these phase ##s just now you saw that image with don ' t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deutsch ##mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uni ##form pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
and then i stuck to it until nine ##te ##en nine ##ty six and then i became the co - found ##er of the company sol ##on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufact ##urer ##s in the world together with the spin - off q - cells .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would ded ##icate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it ' s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what ' s this non ##sens ##e about , that won ' t work . i ' m talking about stor ##age .
i ' ve brought along a project i ' d like to introduce to you .
the title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renew ##able energie ##s .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could impl ##ement a reser ##vo ##ir wise ##ly today .
on this island , that ' s the island gra ##ci ##os ##a on a ##z ##ores .
yes , here is the data .
four and a half thousand people live there .
they have a renew ##able energy share of fif ##te ##en percent at the moment .
the question is , why don ' t they have more ?
because technological ##ly it ' s just not possible .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
that ' s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in berlin - ad ##lers ##hof .
they then also say , why ?
we have twenty percent in germany .
that can ' t be a problem .
but that ' s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the european one .
if we had twenty percent in europe , we ' d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
the question is just , calcul ##ate that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out .
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to twenty , thir ##ty , fort ##y , fif ##ty , maybe even seven ##ty percent renew ##able energie ##s .
and yes , i ' ll move on a slide .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about one hundred gig ##aw ##att ##s electrical output on diesel fuel basis is added in the world per year .
that ' s equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is conver ##ted particularly quickly .
the world ' s hunger for energy that we are seeing is rel ##ie ##ved with diesel fuel , because you don ' t need a licen ##se for it .
it goes fast .
you put a box like this over there .
and that generally looks like this .
in it , there are always three diesel ##s running , two are always maint ##ained .
yes , that ' s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
we were given very accurate data .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back - up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quant ##ities .
our object ##ive was to simply say , okay ,
the diesel will be the back - up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
and if you want to exc ##e ##ed twenty , thir ##ty percent renew ##able energie ##s , you have to switch off diesel .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renew ##able energie ##s can take over the entire network .
of course you can only do that if you ' re being managed here somehow .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your sh ##av ##ing machine in the car vi ##a a small power inv ##erte ##r .
people always ask me , what are you research ##ing in ad ##lers ##hof all the time ?
that is do ##able .
but if you want to hook up several of these power inv ##erte ##r ##s and they are supposed to constru ##ct a network , it becomes highly complicated .
and our a ##im was , we wanted to reach seven ##ty to nine ##ty percent renew ##able energie ##s and then this remain ##der is still here , the last remain ##der , the last ten , twenty percent renew ##able energie ##s with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener ##ating this from batterie ##s won ' t work either .
that will definitely be an energy car ##rie ##r which will be hydrogen meth ##ane , power to gas you know al ##r , that ' s what it will be .
you will then rather have to go to a season ##al reser ##vo ##ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run - of - the - mill electro ##chem ##ical battery .
how far would you get with that ?
and then we tried out a whole load of simulation ##s .
and we simul ##ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fif ##ty cents per k ##wh after twenty years , you ' d arr ##ive at about fort ##y - four cents .
those were the first calcul ##ations six years ago .
and then we said , okay ,
that ' s great , then we have a business model .
we ' re cheap ##er than the diesel system , if the price of diesel rise ##s by five percent a year .
and then we started negot ##iat ##ing with the island ##ers .
what needed to be done ?
we negot ##iated with invest ##ors , i looked for new share ##hol ##ders .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could rebuild the organisation .
and here you have the graph ##ic again .
the brown bit is the conventional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent diesel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn ' t break through to the other things .
and the power ut ##ility , which which the electric ut ##ility on the island , said they think it ' s great .
they said , we want to support it , but we don ' t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that ' s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we could precise ##ly recon ##stru ##ct , so to speak , the electrical rat ##io of the island on a one to three scale .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
naturally it ' s from asia , in this case from japan .
and fun ##n ##ily enough it was developed at the b ##b ##c mann ##heim , called ab ##b today , in the seven ##ties , and was then licen ##sed to the japanese .
it is you can see that it ' s a very , very big battery .
it has a mega ##wa ##tt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it ' s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
and then presented .
we also brought one of these diesel ag ##greg ##ates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the diesel is behind it , here ' s the big battery , here are all the conver ##ters , with which we simul ##ate the network .
over here we simul ##ate the entire trans ##mission gu ##ida ##n ##ce system , the ca ##ble ' s kilometer physics , to illustr ##ate the vibr ##ation behavior , so to speak , in the network .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
we can also add a photo vol ##t ##ai ##c output of two hundred kil ##ow ##att + to the network .
we can see it again here we can see the diesel again here , and all the individual ag ##greg ##ates here .
and what we did , the hall was complete ##d in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and twe ##lv ##e , we developed practical ##ly everything that could be developed electronic ##ally and in terms of software between the individual systems .
so we ' re not battery manufact ##urer ##s , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
you have to be able to cat ##er for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
the nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anti ##ci ##pa ##te all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renew ##able energie ##s .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have twenty - five - thir ##ty percent exc ##ess energy , so we have to limit the wind and sun .
of course this len ##ds itself to a smart grid .
smart grid ##s are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
we can start integr ##ating electro - mobil ##ity on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
that means that if you ' re at seven ##ty percent renew ##able energie ##s , then you won ' t be able to do that without a reser ##vo ##ir .
you can he ##ed the share by using one of these smart grid ##s , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you ' ll never be able to do without the reser ##vo ##ir completely .
and that ' s kind of the message .
that ' s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will ar ##ise .
if we turn off the diesel , then you will no longer have this rot ##ating mass , which causes a certain amount of id ##len ##ess in the network .
and our european energy grid basically cons ##ists of rot ##ating masse ##s of large power plants , where the ax ##le always rev ##ol ##ves around the whole of europe .
we look into this network , see the fif ##ty her ##tz , and if it turns into fort ##y nine point nine her ##tz , we start to open a few small val ##ves , then a little more ste ##am can enter , and then it goes up again .
that ' s the system .
and of course that ' s incredibly slow .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
the spin ##ning reser ##ve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stab ##le .
and in that time you can react differently .
if you don ' t have this rot ##ating mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electronic ##s and electro - chemistry .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two mill ##ise ##con ##ds .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these rot ##ating masse ##s , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thir ##ty , thir ##ty percent etc .
and then we have to decre ##ase our must - run capac ##ities in the network .
must - run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequen ##cy .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , addition ##al construction of coal - burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn ' t have , or gas tur ##bi ##nes , because that ' s not possible .
and we ' re just trying to demonstr ##ate that we can decre ##ase the capac ##ities , the must - run capac ##ities , by putting electro ##chem ##ical reser ##vo ##ir ##s in the network too .
thank ##fully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experiment ##al equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
and yes , the discussion always rev ##ol ##ves around how much of the future you can anti ##ci ##pa ##te .
and many discussion ##s i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thir ##ty years regard ##ing photo ##vo ##lt ##ai ##c ##s .
you can ' t do it , it ' s non ##sens ##e , a play ##thing for kids , we calcul ##ated everything , it will never add up .
we have thir ##ty gig ##aw ##att of photo - vol ##t ##ai ##c power in germany .
that ' s ex ##em ##pl ##ary .
and i simply assum ##e that we ' ll have the same capacity of electro ##chem ##ical reser ##vo ##ir ##s in the whole world for the next thir ##ty years .
it ' s simple , that ' s what will happen .
there will be a whole load of resistance and arguments .
the nice thing is that i ' ve experienced that scientists have been join ##ing my side in the last couple of years .
we ' ve been given over ten million fund ##ed projects , also to attach a ten - mega ##wa ##tt battery to the german network .
that will take place next april .
so you ' re not ##icing a change is taking place , from a defen ##s ##ive att ##itude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent renew ##able energie ##s is right .
and when you have one hundred percent renew ##able energie ##s , then it ' s like a self - suff ##ic ##ient system .
up till now the following is always argue ##d in discussion ##s , these island ##ers are becoming self - suff ##ic ##ient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our join ##t network .
the the question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fuels which are dr ##illed out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they ' re an island .
then they ' ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
and that is kind of our vision of sens ##ible energy use and i am grat ##ef ##ul to the cra ##dle to cra ##dle institute that they said , use solar power .
and that ' s what we ' re doing , and so in this sense we ' re coming together , also if you look at the presentation by prem ##ium cola , that it ' s okay to be a collective and use solar power .
and yes , well , i ' d just like to motiv ##ate you , in the sense that it ' s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty firm while doing so , but i think it ' s it ' s possible .
thank you .
one day , los angeles times colum ##nis ##t steve lo ##pe ##z was walking along the streets of down ##to ##wn los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an african - american man , char ##ming , ru ##g ##ged , home ##less , playing a viol ##in that only had two string ##s .
and i ' m telling a story that many of you know , because steve ' s colum ##ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert down ##e ##y j ##r . acting as steve lo ##pe ##z , and jam ##ie fox ##x as nathan ##iel ant ##ho ##ny a ##yers , the ju ##ill ##iar ##d - trained double bas ##s ##ist whose prom ##ising career was cut short by a trag ##ic aff ##lic ##t ##ion with par ##an ##oid schizophren ##ia .
nathan ##iel dropped out of ju ##ill ##iar ##d , he suffer ##ed a complete break ##do ##wn , and 30 years later he was living home ##less on the streets of ski ##d row in down ##to ##wn los angeles .
i encourage all of you to read steve ' s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrument ##al - - if you ' ll par ##do ##n the pun - - in helping nathan ##iel get off the streets .
i met mr . a ##yers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal ##t dis ##ney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance of beet ##ho ##ven ' s first and fourth symph ##onie ##s , and came back ##stage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo ##v ##ial and gre ##gar ##ious way about y ##o - y ##o ma and hill ##ary clinton and how the do ##d ##gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre ##acher ##ous first viol ##in pass ##age work in the last movement of beet ##ho ##ven ' s fourth symph ##ony .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathan ##iel was interested in a viol ##in lesson with me .
now , i should mention that nathan ##iel ref ##uses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and th ##ora ##zin ##e and hand ##c ##uf ##fs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is pro ##ne to these schizophren ##ic ep ##is ##odes , the worst of which can manife ##st themselves as and then disappear ##ing for days , wander ##ing the streets of ski ##d row , exp ##osed to its horr ##ors , with the tor ##ment of his own mind un ##le ##ash ##ed upon him .
and nathan ##iel was in such a state of ag ##itation when we started our first lesson at wal ##t dis ##ney concert hall - - he had a kind of man ##ic gl ##int in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demon ##s and smoke , and how someone was po ##ison ##ing him in his sleep .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin ##k into one of his states , and that i would ru ##in his relationship with the viol ##in if i started talking about scale ##s and ar ##pe ##g ##g ##ios and other exciting forms of did ##act ##ic viol ##in ped ##ago ##g ##y .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the beet ##ho ##ven viol ##in concert ##o .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change occur ##ring in nathan ##iel ' s eyes .
it was as if he was in the gr ##ip of some invisible pharm ##ace ##ut ##ical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat ##aly ##st .
and nathan ##iel ' s man ##ic ra ##ge was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and in a mir ##acle , he lift ##ed his own viol ##in and he started playing , by ear , certain sn ##ippe ##ts of viol ##in concert ##os which he then asked me to complete - - men ##del ##ss ##oh ##n , t ##ch ##ai ##ko ##v ##sk ##y , s ##ibe ##li ##us .
and we started talking about music , from ba ##ch to beet ##ho ##ven and bra ##hm ##s , bru ##ck ##ner , all the b ' s , from bar ##to ##k , all the way up to es ##a - pe ##k ##ka sal ##onen .
and i understood that he not only had an enc ##y ##cl ##ope ##di ##c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles phil ##har ##mon ##ic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the par ##an ##oid , dist ##ur ##bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down ##to ##wn los angeles to the char ##ming , er ##ud ##ite , brilliant , ju ##ill ##iar ##d - trained music ##ian .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathan ##iel , music is san ##ity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del ##usions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an esc ##ape from his tor ##mented state .
and i understood that this was the very essen ##ce of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artist ##ic lens , through our creativity , we ' re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reach ##es all of us and moves us , inspir ##es and unit ##es us .
and for nathan ##iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the rede ##mp ##t ##ive power of music brought him back into a family of music ##ians that understood him , that recognize ##d his talent ##s and respect ##ed him .
and i will always make music with nathan ##iel , whether we ' re at wal ##t dis ##ney concert hall or on ski ##d row , because he remind ##s me why i became a music ##ian .
thank you .
bru ##no g ##ius ##sa ##n ##i : thank you . thanks .
robert gu ##pt ##a .
robert gu ##pt ##a : i ' m going to play something that i shame ##less ##ly stol ##e from cell ##ists .
so , please forg ##ive me .
so , i ' ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i ' ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff ##air .
it was a beautiful fish : fl ##avor ##ful , text ##ured , meat ##y , a best ##sel ##ler on the men ##u .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm - raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i ' d speak at an event about the farm ' s sustainability .
" absolutely , " i said .
here was a company trying to solve what ' s become this uni ##ma ##gin ##able problem for us chef ##s : how do we keep fish on our men ##us ?
for the past 50 years , we ' ve been fishing the seas like we clear - cut forest ##s .
it ' s hard to over ##sta ##te the destruction .
nine ##ty percent of large fish , the ones we love - - the tun ##as , the hal ##ib ##ut ##s , the sal ##mon ##s , sw ##ord ##fish - - they ' ve collapse ##d .
there ' s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aqu ##ac ##ulture , fish farm ##ing , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farm ##s poll ##ute - - most of them do anyway - - and they ' re ine ##ffic ##ient . take tun ##a , a major draw ##back .
it ' s got a feed convers ##ion rat ##io of 15 to one .
that means it takes fif ##te ##en pounds of wild fish to get you one po ##und of farm tun ##a .
not very sustainable .
it doesn ' t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of p . r . for the company .
let ' s call him don .
" don , " i said , " just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farm ##ing so far out to sea , you don ' t poll ##ute . "
" that ' s right , " he said . " we ' re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concent ##rate ##d . "
and then he added , " we ' re basically a world unt ##o ourselves .
that feed convers ##ion rat ##io ? 2 . 5 to one , " he said .
" best in the business . "
2 . 5 to one , great .
" 2 . 5 what ? what are you feeding ? "
" sustainable proteins , " he said .
" great , " i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , " don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? "
he said he didn ' t know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolog ##ist .
let ' s call him don too .
" don , " i said , " what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? "
well , he mentioned some al ##ga ##es and some fish me ##als , and then he said chicken pe ##lle ##ts .
i said , " chicken pe ##lle ##ts ? "
he said , " yeah , fe ##athers , skin , bone me ##al , sc ##ra ##ps , dr ##ied and process ##ed into feed . "
i said , " what percentage of your feed is chicken ? "
thinking , you know , two percent .
" well , it ' s about 30 percent , " he said .
i said , " don , what ' s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? "
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , " there ' s just too much chicken in the world . "
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because i ' m some self - right ##e ##ous , good ##y - two shoes food ##ie .
i actually am .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swe ##ar to god , after that conversation , the fish taste ##d like chicken .
this second fish , it ' s a different kind of love story .
it ' s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern sp ##ain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost sh ##immer ##ing , white color .
the chef had over ##co ##oke ##d it .
like twice over .
amazing ##ly , it was still del ##icious .
who can make a fish taste good after it ' s been over ##co ##oke ##d ?
i can ' t , but this guy can .
let ' s call him mig ##uel - - actually his name is mig ##uel .
and no , he didn ' t cook the fish , and he ' s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
he ' s a biolog ##ist at ve ##t ##a la palm ##a .
it ' s a fish farm in the south ##west ##ern corner of sp ##ain .
it ' s at the t ##ip of the gu ##ada ##l ##qu ##iv ##ir river .
until the 1980 ##s , the farm was in the hands of the arg ##ent ##ini ##ans .
they raised bee ##f cat ##t ##le on what was essentially we ##t ##lands .
they did it by dra ##ining the land .
they built this intr ##icate series of can ##als , and they push ##ed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn ' t make it work , not economic ##ally .
and ec ##ological ##ly , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 198 ##2 , a span ##ish company with an environmental cons ##ci ##ence pur ##ch ##ased the land .
what did they do ?
they reverse ##d the flow of water .
they literally flip ##ped the switch .
instead of push ##ing water out , they used the channel ##s to pull water back in .
they flo ##ode ##d the can ##als .
they created a 27 , 000 - ac ##re fish farm - - bas ##s , mu ##lle ##t , shr ##imp , e ##el - - and in the process , mig ##uel and this company completely reverse ##d the ec ##ological destruction .
the farm ' s incredible .
i mean , you ' ve never seen anything like this .
you star ##e out at a horiz ##on that is a million miles away , and all you see are flo ##ode ##d can ##als and this thick , rich mars ##hl ##and .
i was there not long ago with mig ##uel .
he ' s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro ##co ##di ##le dun ##de ##e .
okay ? there we are sl ##og ##ging through the we ##t ##lands , and i ' m pan ##ting and swe ##ating , got mu ##d up to my knee ##s , and mig ##uel ' s cal ##m ##ly condu ##cting a biology lecture .
here , he ' s point ##ing out a rare black - shoulder ##ed kit ##e .
now , he ' s mention ##ing the miner ##al needs of ph ##y ##to ##plan ##kton .
and here , here he sees a group ##ing pattern that remind ##s him of the tanz ##ania ##n gir ##aff ##e .
it turns out , mig ##uel spent the better part of his career in the mik ##um ##i national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , " fish ? i didn ' t know anything about fish .
i ' m an expert in relationships . "
and then he ' s off , launch ##ing into more talk about rare birds and al ##ga ##es and strange aqu ##atic plants .
and don ' t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio ##t ##ic community un ##pl ##ug ##ged , kind of thing .
it ' s great , but i was in love .
and my head was sw ##oon ##ing over that over ##co ##oke ##d piece of del ##icious fish i had the night before .
so i inter ##rupt ##ed him . i said , " mig ##uel , what makes your fish taste so good ? "
he point ##ed at the al ##ga ##e .
" i know , du ##de , the al ##ga ##e , the ph ##y ##to ##plan ##kton , the relationships : it ' s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what ' s the feed convers ##ion rat ##io ? "
well , he goes on to tell me it ' s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they ' d be eating in the wild .
the plant biom ##ass , the ph ##y ##to ##plan ##kton , the zo ##op ##la ##n ##kton , it ' s what feed ##s the fish .
the system is so healthy , it ' s totally self - renew ##ing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn ' t feed its animals ?
later that day , i was driving around this property with mig ##uel , and i asked him , i said , " for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i ' d ever been at , how do you measure success ? "
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we round ##ed the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink fl ##aming ##os , a liter ##al pink car ##pet for as far as you could see .
" that ' s success , " he said .
" look at their bell ##ies , pink .
they ' re fe ##ast ##ing . "
fe ##ast ##ing ? i was totally conf ##used .
i said , " mig ##uel , aren ' t they fe ##ast ##ing on your fish ? "
" yes , " he said .
" we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 600 , 000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it ' s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san ##ct ##ua ##ries in all of europe . "
i said , " mig ##uel , isn ' t a thr ##iving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? "
he sh ##ook his head , no .
he said , " we farm extens ##ively , not intens ##ively .
this is an ec ##ological network .
the fl ##aming ##os eat the shr ##imp .
the shr ##imp eat the ph ##y ##to ##plan ##kton .
so the pink ##er the bell ##y , the better the system . "
okay , so let ' s review : a farm that doesn ' t feed its animals , and a farm that measure ##s its success on the health of its pred ##ators .
a fish farm , but also a bird san ##ct ##ua ##ry .
oh , and by the way , those fl ##aming ##os , they shouldn ' t even be there in the first place .
they bro ##od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nest ##s .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they ' re able to follow the broken white line of high ##way a ##9 ##2 .
no kid ##ding .
i was imag ##ining a " march of the penguins " thing , so i looked at mig ##uel .
i said , " mig ##uel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? "
he looked at me like i had just quote ##d a wh ##it ##ney hous ##ton song .
he said , " no ; they do it because the food ' s better . "
i didn ' t mention the skin of my belo ##ved fish , which was del ##icious - - and i don ' t like fish skin ; i don ' t like it sea ##red , i don ' t like it cris ##p ##y .
it ' s that ac ##ri ##d , tar - like fl ##avor .
i almost never cook with it .
yet , when i taste ##d it at that restaurant in southern sp ##ain , it taste ##d not at all like fish skin .
it taste ##d sweet and clean , like you were taking a bit ##e of the ocean .
i mentioned that to mig ##uel , and he no ##d ##ded .
he said , " the skin acts like a spo ##ng ##e .
it ' s the last defense before anything enter ##s the body .
it evolved to so ##ak up imp ##ur ##ities . "
and then he added , " but our water has no imp ##ur ##ities . "
ok . a farm that doesn ' t feed its fish , a farm that measure ##s its success by the success of its pred ##ators .
and then i realized when he says , " a farm that has no imp ##ur ##ities , " he made a big under ##sta ##tem ##ent , because the water that flow ##s through that farm comes in from the gu ##ada ##l ##qu ##iv ##ir river .
it ' s a river that car ##ries with it all the things that river ##s tend to carry these days : chemical cont ##amin ##ants , pe ##stic ##ide run ##off .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is clean ##er than when it enter ##ed .
the system is so healthy , it pur ##if ##ies the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn ' t feed its animals , not just a farm that measure ##s its success by the health of its pred ##ators , but a farm that ' s literally a water pur ##ification plant - - and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it dum ##ps out into the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i ' ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instru ##ctive .
you might say it ' s a rec ##ipe for the future of good food , whether we ' re talking about bas ##s or bee ##f cat ##t ##le .
what we need now is a radical ##ly new concept ##ion of agriculture , one in which the food actually taste ##s good .
but for a lot people , that ' s a bit too radical .
we ' re not real ##ists , us food ##ies ; we ' re love ##r ##s .
we love farmers ' markets , we love small family farm ##s , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will ens ##ure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , " hey guy , i love pink fl ##aming ##os , but how are you going to feed the world ? "
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i don ' t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough cal ##ories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hung ##ry today .
one billion - - that ' s more than ever before - - because of gross ine ##qu ##al ##ities in distribution , not ton ##na ##ge .
now , i don ' t love this question because it ' s determine ##d the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grain to her ##bi ##vor ##es , pe ##stic ##ides to mon ##oc ##ulture ##s , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agr ##ib ##us ##iness has simply asked , " if we ' re feeding more people more cheap ##ly , how terrible could that be ? "
that ' s been the motivation , it ' s been the just ##ification : it ' s been the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in liquid ##ation , a business that ' s quickly ero ##ding ec ##ological capital that makes that very production possible .
that ' s not a business , and it isn ' t agriculture .
our bread ##bas ##ket is threaten ##ed today , not because of di ##min ##ishing supply , but because of di ##min ##ishing resources .
not by the latest combine and tra ##ctor invention , but by fert ##ile land ; not by pump ##s , but by fresh water ; not by chain ##sa ##ws , but by forest ##s ; and not by fishing boat ##s and net ##s , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let ' s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don ' t look at the agr ##ib ##us ##iness model for the future .
it ' s really old , and it ' s t ##ired .
it ' s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it ' s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let ' s look to the ec ##ological model .
that ' s the one that rel ##ies on two billion years of on - the - job experience .
look to mig ##uel , farmers like mig ##uel .
farm ##s that aren ' t worlds unt ##o themselves ; farm ##s that rest ##ore instead of dep ##let ##e ; farm ##s that farm extens ##ively instead of just intens ##ively ; farmers that are not just produce ##r ##s , but experts in relationships .
because they ' re the ones that are experts in fl ##avor , too .
and if i ' m going to be really honest , they ' re a better chef than i ' ll ever be .
you know , i ' m okay with that , because if that ' s the future of good food , it ' s going to be del ##icious .
thank you .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it ' s that the whole of the data in which we consum ##e is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over ##load , what i ' d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we ' re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
this tool that i ' m using here is a little experiment .
it ' s called p ##iv ##ot , and with p ##iv ##ot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths - - say , accident ##s .
and , right away , i see there ' s a different pattern that emer ##ges .
this is because , in the mid - area here , people are at their most active , and over here they ' re at their most fra ##il .
we can step back out again and then re ##organ ##ize the data by cause of death , seeing that circ ##ul ##atory diseases and cancer are the us ##ual susp ##ect ##s , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age - - say 40 years or less - - we see that accident ##s are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you dr ##ill into that , it ' s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that view ##ing information , view ##ing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information inf ##o - graph ##ic .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sport ##s illustr ##ated ever produced .
it ' s all here ; it ' s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with p ##iv ##ot , you can dr ##ill into a decade .
you can dr ##ill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so i ' m looking at this ; i see the ath ##let ##es that have appear ##ed in this issue , the sport ##s .
i ' m a la ##n ##ce arms ##tr ##ong fan , so i ' ll go ahead and i ' ll click on that , which reve ##als , for me , all the issues in which la ##n ##ce arms ##tr ##ong ' s been a part of .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe ##ek at these , i might think , " well , what about taking a look at all of cy ##cl ##ing ? "
so i can step back , and expand on that .
and i see gre ##g le ##mon ##d now .
and so you get the idea that when you navig ##ate over information this way - - going nar ##row ##er , broad ##er , back ##ing in , back ##ing out - - you ' re not search ##ing , you ' re not brow ##s ##ing .
you ' re doing something that ' s actually a little bit different .
it ' s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to extra ##pol ##ate on this idea a bit with something that ' s a little bit crazy .
what we ' re done here is we ' ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduce ##d it down to a little sum ##mar ##y .
so the sum ##mar ##y cons ##ists of just a little syn ##ops ##is and an icon to indic ##ate the topic ##al area that it comes from .
i ' m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the topic ##al dom ##ains that are most popular on wikipedia .
i ' m going to go ahead and sele ##ct government .
now , having sele ##cted government , i can now see that the wikipedia categ ##ories that most frequen ##t ##ly corresp ##ond to that are time magazine people of the year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contain ##ed within any one wikipedia page .
it ' s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular sum ##mar ##ies , i can then dr ##ill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural science ##s ; some , fewer still , have come from business - - there ' s my bos ##s - - and one has come from music .
and interestingly enough , bon ##o is also a ted prize win ##ner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize win ##ners .
so you see , we ' re navig ##ating the web for the first time as if it ' s actually a web , not from page - to - page , but at a higher level of abstract ##ion .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
i ' m just showing the new york times website here .
so p ##iv ##ot , this application - - i don ' t want to call it a brow ##ser ; it ' s really not a brow ##ser , but you can view web pages with it - - and we bring that zoom ##able technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virt ##ue of just view ##ing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow ##s ##ing history in the exact same way .
so i can dr ##ill into what i ' ve done over specific time frame ##s .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem ##o that i just gave .
and i can sort of repl ##ay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sl ##ice and di ##ce my history , perhaps by my search history - - here , i was doing some ne ##po ##t ##istic search ##ing , looking for bin ##g , over here for live lab ##s p ##iv ##ot .
and from these , i can dr ##ill into the web page and just launch them again .
it ' s one metaphor rep ##ur ##po ##sed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur ##se .
we talk about the cur ##se of information over ##load .
we talk about dro ##wn ##ing in data .
what if we can actually turn that up ##side down and turn the web up ##side down , so that instead of navig ##ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tra ##pped in data , we might actually extra ##ct information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tea ##se out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there ' s wisdom to be found .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up on a ste ##ad ##y diet of science fiction .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and i was always absorb ##ed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisf ##ied , in a narrative form , this ins ##ati ##able sense of curiosity that i had .
and you know , that curiosity also manife ##ste ##d itself in the fact that whenever i wasn ' t in school i was out in the wood ##s , hi ##king and taking " sample ##s " - - fro ##gs and sn ##akes and bug ##s and po ##nd water - - and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
you know , i was a real science gee ##k .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mirror ##ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late ' 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
jac ##ques cous ##te ##au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing special ##s that showed us animals and places and a won ##dro ##us world that we could never really have previous ##ly imagine ##d .
so , that seemed to reson ##ate with the whole science fiction part of it .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that because there weren ' t video games and this sat ##ura ##t ##ion of c ##g movies and all of this image ##ry in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author ' s descri ##ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaces ##hip ##s , all that stuff .
i was end ##less ##ly getting bus ##ted in math class dood ##ling behind the text ##book .
that was - - the creativity had to find its out ##let somehow .
and an interesting thing happened : the jac ##ques cous ##te ##au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spaces ##hip some ##day - - that seemed pretty dar ##n unlike ##ly .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and ex ##otic as anything that i had imagine ##d from reading these books .
so , i decided i was going to become a sc ##ub ##a diver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the near ##est ocean .
but i didn ' t let that dau ##nt me .
i pe ##ster ##ed my father until he finally found a sc ##ub ##a class in bu ##ff ##al ##o , new york , right across the border from where we live .
and i actually got ce ##rt ##ified in a pool at a y ##m ##ca in the dead of winter in bu ##ff ##al ##o , new york .
and i didn ' t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the interv ##en ##ing 40 years , i ' ve spent about 3 , 000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in sub ##mer ##s ##ible ##s .
and i ' ve learned that that deep - ocean environment , and even the shall ##ow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature ' s imagination is so bound ##less compared to our own me ##ager human imagination .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute aw ##e of what i see when i make these div ##es .
and my love aff ##air with the ocean is on ##go ##ing , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when i chose a career as an adult , it was film ##ma ##king .
and that seemed to be the best way to recon ##cil ##e this ur ##ge i had to tell stories with my ur ##ges to create images .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
so , film ##ma ##king was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories : " termin ##ator , " " alien ##s " and " the ab ##ys ##s . "
and with " the ab ##ys ##s , " i was putting together my love of underwater and div ##ing with film ##ma ##king .
so , you know , mer ##ging the two passion ##s .
something interesting came out of " the ab ##ys ##s , " which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embrace ##d computer generated animation , c ##g .
and this result ##ed in the first soft - surface character , c ##g animation that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn ' t make any money - - bare ##ly broke even , i should say - - i witness ##ed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was me ##s ##mer ##ized by this appar ##ent magic .
you know , it ' s arthur clar ##ke ' s law that any suff ##ic ##ient ##ly advanced technology is ind ##ist ##ingu ##ish ##able from magic .
they were seeing something magic ##al .
and so that got me very excited .
and i thought , " wow , this is something that needs to be embrace ##d into the c ##ine ##mat ##ic art . "
so , with " termin ##ator 2 , " which was my next film , we took that much far ##ther .
working with i ##l ##m , we created the liquid metal du ##de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience - - although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , " this is going to be a whole new world , " this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , i started a company with stan win ##ston , my good friend stan win ##ston , who is the prem ##ier make - up and creature designer at that time , and it was called digital dom ##ain .
and the concept of the company was that we would lea ##pf ##ro ##g past the analog processes of opt ##ical print ##ers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a compet ##itive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves lag ##ging in the mid ' 90 ##s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually found ##ed the company to do .
so , i wrote this piece called " av ##atar , " which was meant to absolutely push the en ##velop ##e of visual effects , of c ##g effects , beyond , with real ##istic human emot ##ive characters generated in c ##g , and the main characters would all be in c ##g , and the world would be in c ##g .
and the en ##velop ##e push ##ed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren ' t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i shel ##ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin ##ks .
you know , i went and p ##itch ##ed it to the studio as " ' rom ##e ##o and jul ##iet ' on a ship : " it ' s going to be this ep ##ic roman ##ce , passionate film . "
secret ##ly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to div ##e to the real wr ##ec ##k of " titan ##ic . "
and that ' s why i made the movie .
and that ' s the truth . now , the studio didn ' t know that .
but i convinced them . i said , " we ' re going to div ##e to the wr ##ec ##k . we ' re going to film it for real .
we ' ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . "
and i talked them into funding an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russia ##n sub ##mer ##s ##ible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic , looking at the real titan ##ic through a view port .
not a movie , not h ##d - - for real .
now , that ble ##w my mind .
and it took a lot of prepar ##ation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it stru ##ck me how much this div ##e , these deep div ##es , was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
you get in this cap ##s ##ule , you go down to this dark host ##ile environment where there is no hope of resc ##ue if you can ' t get back by yourself .
and i thought like , " wow . i ' m like , living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . "
and so , i really got bitten by the bug of deep - ocean exploration .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it - - it was everything . it was advent ##ure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn ' t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn ' t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our subs ##e ##quen ##t expedition ##s , i was seeing creatures at hydro ##ther ##mal vent ##s and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image ##d them .
so , i was completely sm ##itten by this , and had to do more .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of " titan ##ic , " i said , " ok , i ' m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie make ##r , and i ' m going to go be a full - time explore ##r for a while . "
and so , we started planning these and we wo ##und up going to the bis ##mark , and exploring it with robot ##ic vehicles .
we went back to the titan ##ic wr ##ec ##k .
we took little bot ##s that we had created that spo ##ole ##d a fiber opt ##ic .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter ##ior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the wr ##ec ##k . they didn ' t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am now , on the dec ##k of titan ##ic , sitting in a sub ##mer ##s ##ible , and looking out at plan ##ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
and i ' m flying a little robot ##ic vehicle through the cor ##ri ##do ##r of the ship .
when i say , " i ' m operating it , " but my mind is in the vehicle .
i felt like i was physically present inside the ship ##w ##re ##ck of titan ##ic .
and it was the most surr ##e ##al kind of de ##ja v ##u experience i ' ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve ##aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact repl ##ica on the blue ##print ##s of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the tele ##pre ##sen ##ce experience - - that you actually can have these robot ##ic av ##atar ##s , then your consciousness is inj ##ect ##ed into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really , really quite profound .
and it may be a little bit of a gl ##imp ##se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy ##bor ##g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post - human future ##s that i can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
so , having done these expedition ##s , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vent ##s where we had these amazing , amazing animals - - they ' re basically alien ##s right here on earth .
they live in an environment of chem ##os ##ynth ##esis .
they don ' t survive on sunlight - based system the way we do .
and so , you ' re seeing animals that are living next to a 500 - degree - cent ##ig ##rad ##e you think they can ' t possibly exist .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well - - again , it ' s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
and i wo ##und up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa adv ##is ##ory board , planning actual space mission ##s , going to russia , going through the pre - cosm ##ona ##ut biom ##ed ##ical proto ##col ##s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what i wo ##und up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access - - astro ##bi ##ologists , planet ##ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments - - taking them down to the vent ##s , and let ##ting them see , and take sample ##s and test instruments , and so on .
so , here we were making document ##ary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
i ' d completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , capt ##ain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
i didn ' t really learn about leadership until i did these expedition ##s .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , " what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? "
we don ' t make money at these dam ##n shows .
we bare ##ly break even . there is no fam ##e in it .
people sort of think i went away between " titan ##ic " and " av ##atar " and was bu ##ffin ##g my na ##ils some ##place , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these document ##ary films for a very limited audience .
no fam ##e , no glo ##ry , no money . what are you doing ?
you ' re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge - - and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is - - for the thr ##ill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a t ##ightly kn ##it team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you ' ve done a task that you can ' t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the sh ##ore and you say , " we had to do this , and the fiber opt ##ic , and the att ##ent ##ua ##t ##ion , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficult ##y , the human - performance aspect ##s of working at sea , " you can ' t explain it to people . it ' s that thing that maybe cop ##s have , or people in comb ##at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was " av ##atar , " i tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here i was again with a small team , in unc ##har ##ted terr ##itor ##y , doing " av ##atar , " coming up with new technology that didn ' t exist before .
tremendous ##ly exciting .
tremendous ##ly challenging .
and we became a family , over a four - and - half year period .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
so , people have comment ##ed on how , " well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pand ##ora . "
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synth ##es ##ize out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , i think number one is curiosity .
it ' s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually manife ##st a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau ##rel ##s in the world .
i have young film ##ma ##ker ##s come up to me and say , " give me some advice for doing this . "
and i say , " don ' t put limit ##ations on yourself .
other people will do that for you - - don ' t do it to yourself , don ' t bet against yourself , and take risks . "
nasa has this phrase that they like : " failure is not an option . "
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it ' s a lea ##p of faith .
and no important ende ##avor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that ' s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you ' re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
i ' m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full - time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccine ##s and seed ##s , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people - - in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their cro ##ps won ' t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their frag ##ile environment simply can ' t support .
and that leads to star ##vation , it leads to uncertain ##ty , it leads to unre ##st .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on adv ##ances in energy .
the coal revolution fuel ##ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 1900 ##s we ' ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that ' s why we have refr ##iger ##ators , air - condition ##ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we ' re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it cheap ##er - - and let ' s go for making it twice as cheap - - we need to meet a new const ##rain ##t , and that const ##rain ##t has to do with co2 .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually a very straight ##for ##ward one .
if you sum up the co2 that gets em ##itte ##d , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the ind ##ire ##ct effects , in that the natural ecosystem ##s can ' t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapse ##s .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedback ##s are , there ' s some uncertain ##ty there , but not very much .
and there ' s certainly uncertain ##ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can ' t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that ' s a big challenge .
it ' s very different than saying " we ' re a twe ##lv ##e - foot - high truck trying to get under a ten - foot bridge , and we can just sort of sque ##e ##ze under . "
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon di ##oxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each american , it ' s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it ' s less than one ton .
it ' s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it ' s been constantly going up .
it ' s only various economic changes that have even flat ##ten ##ed it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of multipl ##ica ##t ##ion : so , you ' ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that ' s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person ' s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let ' s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that ' s back from high school al ##geb ##ra , but let ' s take a look .
first , we ' ve got population .
the world today has 6 . 8 billion people .
that ' s head ##ed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vaccine ##s , health care , reprodu ##ctive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1 . 3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this enc ##om ##pass ##es everything : the food we eat , cloth ##ing , tv , heat ##ing .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it ' s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deliver ##ed per person .
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your home ##work ?
and , in fact , these kids don ' t , so they ' re going out and reading their school work under the street lam ##ps .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that ' s not going up .
through various invention ##s and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings - - there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fert ##il ##izer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for improve ##ment are far , far less .
and so , over ##all here , if we ' re optimistic , we may get a redu ##ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we ' ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won ' t cut it .
so let ' s look at this fourth factor - - this is going to be a key one - - and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renew ##ables and nuclear , puts out co2 .
and so , what we ' re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy mir ##acles .
now , when i use the term " mir ##acle , " i don ' t mean something that ' s impossible .
the micro ##pro ##cess ##or is a mir ##acle . the personal computer is a mir ##acle .
the internet and its services are a mir ##acle .
so , the people here have participate ##d in the creation of many mir ##acles .
usually , we don ' t have a dead ##line , where you have to get the mir ##acle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don ' t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mir ##acle in a pretty t ##ight time ##line .
now , i thought , " how could i really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illustr ##ation , some demonstration that would grab people ' s imagination here ? "
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquit ##os , and somehow people enjoy ##ed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquit ##os .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i decided that rele ##asing fire ##fl ##ies would be my contrib ##ution to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fire ##fl ##ies .
i ' m told they don ' t bit ##e ; in fact , they might not even leave that ja ##r .
now , there ' s all sorts of g ##imm ##ick ##y solutions like that one , but they don ' t really add up to much .
we need solutions - - either one or several - - that have unbelie ##vable scale and unbelie ##vable rel ##ia ##bil ##ity , and , although there ' s many directions people are see ##king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
i ' ve left out t ##ide , ge ##other ##mal , fusion , bio ##f ##uel ##s .
those may make some contrib ##ution , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we ' re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can ' t give up any of them because they look dau ##nt ##ing , because they all have significant challenges .
let ' s look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it ' s not , and that ' s to take all the co2 , after you ' ve burn ##ed it , going out the flu ##e , press ##ur ##ize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stay ##s there .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very trick ##y , and agree ##ing on where these co2 quant ##ities should be put will be hard , but the tough ##est one here is this long - term issue .
who ' s going to be sure ?
who ' s going to gu ##ara ##nte ##e something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that ' s a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul ##ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper ##ators , that the fuel doesn ' t get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it ' s not very large , there are a lot of concern ##s about that .
so three very tough problems that might be sol ##vable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , i ' ve group ##ed together .
these are what people often refer to as the renew ##able sources .
and they actually - - although it ' s great they don ' t require fuel - - they have some dis ##ad ##vant ##ages .
one is that the density of energy gather ##ed in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
this is energy farm ##ing , so you ' re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter ##mitt ##ent sources .
the sun doesn ' t sh ##ine all day , it doesn ' t sh ##ine every day , and , like ##wise , the wind doesn ' t blow all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time period ##s that it ' s not available .
so , we ' ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans ##mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from else ##where .
and , finally , this stor ##age problem .
and , to dimensional ##ize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batterie ##s that get made - - for cars , for computers , for phones , for flash ##light ##s , for everything - - and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batterie ##s we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break ##th ##ro ##ug ##h here , something that ' s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach ##es we have now .
it ' s not impossible , but it ' s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter ##mitt ##ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you ' re using .
if you ' re count ##ing on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mir ##acle battery .
now , how we ' re going to go forward on this - - what ' s the right approach ?
is it a manhattan project ? what ' s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five path ##s , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you ' ll look at and say , " they ' re crazy . " that ' s good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already purs ##uing this .
bill gross has several companies , including one called es ##ola ##r that has some great solar ther ##mal technologies .
vi ##no ##d k ##ho ##sl ##a ' s invest ##ing in dozen ##s of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i ' m trying to help back that .
nathan my ##hr ##vo ##ld and i actually are back ##ing a company that , perhaps surprising ##ly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear : mod ##ular , liquid .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there ' s some good ideas lay ##ing around is not all that surprising .
the idea of terr ##ap ##ower is that , instead of burning a part of ur ##ani ##um - - the one percent , which is the u ##2 ##3 ##5 - - we decided , " let ' s burn the 99 percent , the u ##2 ##3 ##8 . "
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul ##ate properly whether it would work or not , and so it ' s through the advent of modern super ##comput ##ers that now you can simul ##ate and see that , yes , with the right material ' s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you ' re burning that 99 percent , you have great ##ly improve ##d cost prof ##ile .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the left ##over waste from today ' s react ##ors .
so , instead of worry ##ing about them , you just take that . it ' s a great thing .
it breathe ##s this ur ##ani ##um as it goes along , so it ' s kind of like a can ##dle .
you can see it ' s a log there , often refer ##red to as a traveling wave react ##or .
in terms of fuel , this really solve ##s the problem .
i ' ve got a picture here of a place in ken ##t ##uck ##y .
this is the left ##over , the 99 percent , where they ' ve taken out the part they burn now , so it ' s called dep ##let ##ed ur ##ani ##um .
that would power the u . s . for hundreds of years .
and , simply by filter ##ing sea ##water in an ine ##x ##pen ##s ##ive process , you ' d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it ' s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let ' s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let ' s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter ##med ##iate .
for 2050 , you ' ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu ##ction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have clean ##ed up forest ##ry , ce ##ment .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation alt ##oge ##ther .
so , the other grade is : are we deploy ##ing this zero - emiss ##ion technology , have we deploy ##ed it in all the developed countries and we ' re in the process of getting it else ##where ?
that ' s super important .
that ' s a key element of making that report card .
so , back ##ing up from there , what should the 20 ##20 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency measure ##s to start getting redu ##ctions : the less we em ##it , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don ' t get us all the way to the big redu ##ctions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break ##th ##ro ##ug ##h ##s .
these break ##th ##ro ##ug ##h ##s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regul ##atory things that have been changed .
there ' s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the al gore book , " our choice " and the david mc ##ka ##y book , " sustainable energy without the hot air . "
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discuss ##ed broad ##ly , because we need broad back ##ing for this .
there ' s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it ' s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years - - i could pick who ' s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that ' s half the cost with no co2 gets invented - - this is the wish i would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don ' t get this wish , the div ##ision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u . s . and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am i app ##e ##aling to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like cop ##en ##hagen , they shouldn ' t just discuss the co2 .
they should discuss this innovation agenda , and you ' d be stun ##ne ##d at the ridic ##ulous ##ly low levels of spending on these innovative approach ##es .
we do need the market incentives - - co2 tax , cap and trade - - something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialog ##ue be a more rational , more understand ##able dialog ##ue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about terr ##ap ##ower , right - - i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
bil gates : to actually do the software , buy the super ##comput ##er , hir ##e all the great scientists , which we ' ve done , that ' s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russia ##n react ##or to make sure that our materials work properly , then you ' ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pilot react ##or ; finding the several billion , finding the regul ##ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as advert ##ised , then it ' s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this involv ##es building deep into the ground almost like a vert ##ical kind of colum ##n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur ##ani ##um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
b ##g : that ' s right . today , you ' re always ref ##uel ##ing the react ##or , so you have lots of people and lots of control ##s that can go wrong : that thing where you ' re opening it up and moving things in and out , that ' s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in - - just think of it as a log - - put it down and not have those same complex ##ities .
and it just sit ##s there and burn ##s for the 60 years , and then it ' s done .
it ' s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disp ##os ##al solution .
b ##g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there - - there ' s a lot less waste under this approach - - then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that ' s sitting in these cool ##ing pool ##s or dry cas ##king by react ##ors - - that ' s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that ' s been a problem from those react ##ors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you ' re redu ##cing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you ' re going through this process .
i mean , you ' re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
b ##g : well , we haven ' t picked a particular place , and there ' s all these interesting disc ##los ##ure rules about anything that ' s called " nuclear , " so we ' ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china - - i ' ve been back seeing the secret ##ary of energy here , talking about how this fit ##s into the energy agenda .
so i ' m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
this is a vari ##ant on something that has been done .
it ' s an important adv ##ance , but it ' s like a fast react ##or , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who ' s done a fast react ##or is a candid ##ate to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , times ##cal ##e and like ##li ##hood of actually taking something like this live ?
b ##g : well , we need - - for one of these high - scale , electro - generation things that ' s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
that ' s sort of the dead ##line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , terr ##ap ##ower , if things go well - - which is wish ##ing for a lot - - could easily meet that .
and there are , fort ##unately now , dozen ##s of companies - - we need it to be hundreds - - who , like ##wise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compet ##e for this .
and it ' s best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succeed .
in terms of big - scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you ' re aware of out there ?
b ##g : an energy break ##th ##ro ##ug ##h is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental const ##rain ##t , but the environmental const ##rain ##t just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other innov ##ators .
you know , we don ' t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod ##ular people , that ' s a different approach .
there ' s a liquid - type react ##or , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur ##ani ##um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so - - if you can deal with the negative ##s , which are essentially the radiation - - the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn ' t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergency measure ##s to try and keep the temperature of the earth stab ##le ?
b ##g : if you get into that situation , it ' s like if you ' ve been over - eating , and you ' re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what ' s called ge ##oe ##ng ##ine ##ering , which are various techniques that would del ##ay the heat ##ing to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that ' s just an ins ##urance policy .
you hope you don ' t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn ' t even work on the ins ##urance policy because it might make you la ##zy , that you ' ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
i ' m not sure that ' s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there ' s now the ge ##oe ##ng ##ine ##ering discussion about - - should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slow ##er than we expect ?
climate skept ##ics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persu ##ade them that they ' re wrong ?
b ##g : well , unfortunately , the skept ##ics come in different camp ##s .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
are they saying that there ' s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that off ##set things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there ' s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it ' s kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur ##gen ##t problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing - - in fact , the ip ##cc report , that ' s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at ip ##cc and say , " ok , that isn ' t that big of a deal . "
the fact is it ' s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 const ##rain ##ts , then the skept ##ics say , " ok , i don ' t care that it doesn ' t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i ' ll accept it because it ' s cheap ##er than what ' s come before . "
and so , that would be your response to the b ##jor ##n lo ##m ##bor ##g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it ' s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it ' s a stupid waste of the earth ' s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
b ##g : well , the actual spending on the r & amp ; d piece - - say the u . s . should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now - - it ' s not that dramatic .
it shouldn ' t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reason ##able people can dis ##ag ##ree , is when you have something that ' s non - economic and you ' re trying to fund that - - that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you ' re very close and you ' re just funding the learning curve and it ' s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the trade - off you get into is , " let ' s make energy super expensive , " then the rich can afford that .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even lo ##m ##bor ##g has changed .
his sh ##t ##ick now is , " why isn ' t the r & amp ; d getting more discuss ##ed ? "
he ' s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skept ##ic camp , but he ' s realized that ' s a pretty lon ##el ##y camp , and so , he ' s making the r & amp ; d point .
and so there is a thr ##e ##ad of something that i think is appropriate .
the r & amp ; d piece , it ' s crazy how little it ' s fund ##ed .
well bill , i susp ##ect i speak on the beha ##l ##f of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
b ##g : thank you .
several years ago here at ted , peter skill ##man introduced a design challenge called the mars ##hm ##allow challenge .
and the idea ' s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tall ##est free - standing structure out of 20 sticks of sp ##ag ##het ##t ##i , one y ##ard of tape , one y ##ard of string and a mars ##hm ##allow .
the mars ##hm ##allow has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it ' s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor ##ate very quickly .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i inc ##or ##por ##ated it into a design works ##ho ##p .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , i ' ve condu ##cted about 70 design works ##ho ##ps across the world with students and designers and architects , even the c ##to ##s of the fortune 50 , and there ' s something about this exercise that reve ##als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i ' d like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by orient ##ing themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it ' s going to look like , they jo ##cke ##y for power .
then they spend some time planning , organ ##izing , they sket ##ch and they lay out sp ##ag ##het ##t ##i .
they spend the majority of their time assem ##bling the sticks into ever - growing structures .
and then finally , just as they ' re running out of time , someone takes out the mars ##hm ##allow , and then they ging ##er ##ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and - - ta - da ! - - they adm ##ire their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the " ta - da " turns into an " uh - oh , " because the weight of the mars ##hm ##allow causes the entire structure to buck ##le and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more " uh - oh " moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduate ##s of business school .
they lie , they che ##at , they get distr ##act ##ed and they produce really lam ##e structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more " ta - da " structures , and among the best are recent graduate ##s of kinder ##gar ##ten .
and it ' s pretty amazing .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the tall ##est structures , but they ' re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and peter like ##s to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce ##o of sp ##ag ##het ##t ##i , inc . right ?
they don ' t spend time jo ##cke ##ying for power .
but there ' s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they exec ##ute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the mars ##hm ##allow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it ' s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kinder ##gar ##ten ##ers do differently is that they start with the mars ##hm ##allow , and they build prototyp ##es , success ##ive prototyp ##es , always keeping the mars ##hm ##allow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototyp ##es along the way .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essen ##ce of the it ##era ##t ##ive process .
and with each version , kids get inst ##ant feedback about what works and what doesn ' t work .
so the capacity to play in prototyp ##e is really essential , but let ' s look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 inc ##hes ; business schools students , about half of that ; law ##yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder ##gar ##ten ##ers , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , thank ##fully .
thir ##ty - nine inc ##hes is the tall ##est structure i ' ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand tri ##ang ##les and self - rein ##for ##cing geomet ##ric ##al patterns are the key to building stab ##le structures .
so ce ##os , a little bit better than average , but here ' s where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an exec ##ut ##ive adm ##in . on the team , they get significant ##ly better .
it ' s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , " oh , that team ' s going to win . "
you can just tell before ##hand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of fac ##il ##itation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who manage ##s and pay ##s close attention to work will significant ##ly improve the team ' s performance .
special ##ized skills and fac ##il ##itation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you ' ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let ' s up the ant ##e , once .
so i offered a 10 , 000 dollar prize of software to the win ##ning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here ' s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inc ##h structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn ' t that interesting ? that high sta ##kes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototyp ##ing .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tall ##est structures in the least amount of time .
so there ' s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mars ##hm ##allow challenge ?
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the mars ##hm ##allow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assum ##ption ##s .
because , frankly , every project has its own mars ##hm ##allow , doesn ' t it ?
the challenge provide ##s a shared experience , a common language , a common stan ##ce to build the right prototyp ##e .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mars ##hm ##allow ##ch ##allen ##ge . com .
it ' s a blog that you can look at how to build the mars ##hm ##allow ##s .
there ' s step - by - step instru ##ctions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people twe ##ak and adjust the system .
there ' s world records that are on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
it demand ##s that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototyp ##e of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an " uh - oh " moment to a " ta - da " moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let ' s pret ##end right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , ted - is ##h machine , and it ' s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back ##wards , you can go forward ##s ; you cannot stay where you are .
and i wonder what you ' d choose , because i ' ve been asking my friends this question a lot late ##ly and they all want to go back .
i don ' t know . they want to go back before there were automob ##iles or twitter or " american id ##ol . "
i don ' t know .
i ' m convinced that there ' s some sort of pull to no ##sta ##l ##g ##ia , to wish ##ful thinking .
and i understand that .
i ' m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
i don ' t want to go back , and it ' s not because i ' m advent ##ur ##ous .
it ' s because possibilities on this planet , they don ' t go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there ' s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobil ##ity , opportunity , dec ##lin ##ing rates of disease . . .
there ' s never been a time like this .
my great - grand ##par ##ents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grand ##par ##ents push ##ed that number to 70 .
my parents are clos ##ing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it ' s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the rich ##est man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it ' s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
small ##po ##x . small ##po ##x killed billions of people on this planet .
it res ##ha ##ped the demograph ##y of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it ' s gone . it ' s van ##ished .
we van ##qu ##ished it . pu ##ff .
in the rich world , diseases that threaten ##ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hard ##ly .
di ##ph ##ther ##ia , rub ##ell ##a , polio . . .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vaccine ##s , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri ##ump ##h ##s of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method - - trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn ' t - - is one of the great accompl ##ishment ##s of humanity .
so that ' s the good news .
unfortunately , that ' s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they ' ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that despite all our accompl ##ishment ##s , a billion people go to bed hung ##ry in this world every day .
that number ' s rising , and it ' s rising really rapidly , and it ' s dis ##gra ##ce ##ful .
and not only that , we ' ve used our imagination to th ##or ##ough ##ly tra ##sh this globe .
pot ##able water , arab ##le land , rain ##fore ##sts , oil , gas : they ' re going away , and they ' re going away soon , and unless we innov ##ate our way out of this mess , we ' re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
i think it ' s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without rap ##ing the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn ' t also destroy it .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain ' t wish ##ful thinking .
but here ' s the thing that keeps me up at night - - one of the things that keeps me up at night : we ' ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we ' ve also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
we ' re on the verg ##e of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we ' d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enl ##ighten ##ment , to find a time when we battle ##d progress , when we fo ##ught about these things more vi ##gor ##ously , on more front ##s , than we do now .
people wra ##p themselves in their belief ##s , and they do it so t ##ightly that you can ' t set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone ' s ent ##it ##led to their opinion ; they ' re even ent ##it ##led to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you ' re not ent ##it ##led to ?
you ' re not ent ##it ##led to your own facts . sorry , you ' re not .
and this took me aw ##hil ##e to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccine ##s for the new yorker . a little story .
and i was amaz ##ed to find oppos ##ition : oppos ##ition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn ' t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genetic ##ally engineer ##ed food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn ' t understand why people thought this was " frank ##en ##f ##oods , " why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha ##ph ##az ##ard way , was tre ##sp ##ass ##ing on nature ' s ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
i mean , i ' m a journalist .
we type , we fil ##e , we go to dinner . it ' s fine .
but these stories both ##ered me , and i couldn ' t figure out why , and eventually i did .
and that ' s because those fan ##atic ##s that were driving me crazy weren ' t actually fan ##atic ##s at all .
they were thought ##ful people , educ ##ated people , dec ##ent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just dist ##ur ##bed me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let ' s be honest .
we ' re at a point in this world where we don ' t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it amb ##ivalent ##ly .
we talk about it in iron ##ic terms with little quote ##s around it : " progress . "
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we ' ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there ' s no reason we shouldn ' t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
che ##r ##no ##by ##l , b ##ho ##pa ##l , the challenge ##r , vi ##ox ##x , weapons of mass destruction , hang ##ing cha ##ds .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skept ##ical .
ask questions , demand pro ##of , demand evidence .
don ' t take anything for gra ##nte ##d .
but here ' s the thing : when you get pro ##of , you need to accept the pro ##of , and we ' re not that good at doing that .
and the reason that i can say that is because we ' re now in an epidemic of fear like one i ' ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the meas ##les , mu ##mp ##s and rub ##ell ##a vaccine shot .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it ' s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe ##den , from canada , and it was all the same : no correl ##ation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn ' t matter . it doesn ' t matter because we believe an ##ecd ##ote ##s , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don ' t believe a bunch of document ##s from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been dis ##ast ##ro ##us .
dis ##ast ##ro ##us because here ' s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for meas ##les is going down .
that is dis ##gra ##ce ##ful , and we should be as ##ham ##ed of ourselves .
it ' s horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have meas ##les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas ##les ?
doesn ' t happen very much .
doesn ' t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16 ##0 , 000 times in the world last year .
that ' s a lot of death of meas ##les - - 20 an hour .
but since it didn ' t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jen ##ny mc ##car ##th ##y can go around pre ##ach ##ing messages of fear and ill ##iter ##acy from platform ##s like " op ##rah " and " larry king live . "
and they can do it because they don ' t link caus ##ation and correl ##ation .
they don ' t understand that these things seem the same , but they ' re almost never the same .
and it ' s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , jon ##as sal ##k .
he took one of the worst sc ##our ##ges of man ##kind away from us .
no fear , no ago ##ny . polio - - pu ##ff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul off ##it .
he just developed a rot ##av ##ir ##us vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it ' ll save the lives of 400 to 500 , 000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it ' s good , except that paul goes around talking about vaccine ##s and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh ##ining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul ' s a terror ##ist .
when paul speak ##s in a public hearing , he can ' t test ##ify without arme ##d guard ##s .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don ' t need to say this , but vaccine ##s are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that ' s happening .
we have meas ##les in this country now .
and it ' s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it ' s just a numbers game .
and they ' re not just going to die of meas ##les .
what about polio ? let ' s have that . why not ?
a college class ##mat ##e of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little str ##ident .
no one ' s ever said that before .
she wasn ' t going to vacc ##ina ##te her kid against polio , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don ' t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn ' t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don ' t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in lag ##os this morning , and he ' s flying to la ##x , right now he ' s over oh ##io .
and he ' s going to land in a couple of hours , he ' s going to rent a car , and he ' s going to come to long beach , and he ' s going to att ##end one of these fab ##ulous ted dinner ##s tonight .
and he doesn ' t know that he ' s infected with a paraly ##t ##ic disease , and we don ' t either because that ' s the way the world works .
that ' s the planet we live on . don ' t pret ##end it isn ' t .
now , we love to wra ##p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vit ##amin ##s this morning ?
ech ##ina ##ce ##a , a little anti ##ox ##ida ##nt to get you going .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medicine ##s , and it doesn ' t matter how often we find out that they ' re use ##less .
the data says it all the time .
they dark ##en your ur ##ine . they almost never do more than that .
it ' s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur ##ine ?
i ' m totally with you .
dark ur ##ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we hate big pharm ##a .
we hate big government . we don ' t trust the man .
and we shouldn ' t : our health care system suc ##ks .
it ' s cru ##el to millions of people .
it ' s absolutely astonishing ##ly cold and soul - ben ##ding to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we lea ##p into the arms of big place ##bo .
that ' s fantastic . i love big place ##bo .
but , you know , it ' s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra ##p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little prop ##s here .
none of it . . . g ##ink ##go , frau ##d ; ech ##ina ##ce ##a , frau ##d ; ac ##ai - - i don ' t even know what that is but we ' re spending billions of dollars on it - - it ' s frau ##d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre ##am at me , and they say , " what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . "
and you know what ? you ' re wrong .
because i don ' t care if it ' s the secret ##ary of h ##h ##s who ' s saying , " hmm , i ' m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mamm ##ogra ##ms , " or some cancer qu ##ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem ##as .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don ' t want to be .
you end up in th ##ab ##o m ##be ##ki south africa .
he killed 400 , 000 of his people by ins ##ist ##ing that beet ##ro ##ot , gar ##lic and le ##mon oil were much more effective than the anti ##ret ##ro ##vir ##al drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of need ##less deaths in a country that has been pl ##ag ##ued worse than any other by this disease .
please , don ' t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mind ##less epidemic we ' re in the middle of right now is this abs ##ur ##d battle between prop ##onen ##ts of genetic ##ally engineer ##ed food and the organic elite .
it ' s an id ##iot ##ic debate . it has to stop .
it ' s a debate about words , about metaphor ##s .
it ' s ide ##ology , it ' s not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of r ##ice , every spr ##ig of par ##sl ##e ##y , every bru ##ss ##els spr ##out has been mod ##ified by man .
you know , there weren ' t ta ##ng ##erin ##es in the garden of ed ##en .
there wasn ' t any can ##t ##al ##ou ##pe .
there weren ' t christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 11 , 000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn ' t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn ' t .
now we can do it in a more precise way - - and there are risks , absolutely - - but we can put something like vit ##amin a into r ##ice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro ##lo ##ng their lives .
you don ' t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don ' t understand it .
we object to genetic ##ally engineer ##ed food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pe ##stic ##ides , horm ##ones , mon ##oc ##ulture , we don ' t want giant fields of the same thing , that ' s wrong .
we don ' t companies patent ##ing life .
we don ' t want companies own ##ing seed ##s .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you ' re right . let ' s fix it .
it ' s true , we ' ve got a huge food problem , but this isn ' t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it ' s law , it ' s moral ##ity , it ' s patent stuff .
you know science isn ' t a company .
it ' s not a country .
it ' s not even an idea ; it ' s a process .
it ' s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ' t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we ' re afraid , is really very dead ##en ##ing , and it ' s prevent ##ing millions of people from pros ##per ##ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we ' re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
dis ##gra ##ce ##ful . dis ##gra ##ce ##ful .
they need it , and we ' re not giving it to them .
and why ? genetic ##ally engineer ##ed food .
we don ' t want to encourage people to eat that rot ##ten stuff , like cas ##sa ##va for instance .
cas ##sa ##va ' s something that half a billion people eat .
it ' s kind of like a pot ##at ##o .
it ' s just a bunch of cal ##ories . it suc ##ks .
it doesn ' t have nutr ##ients , it doesn ' t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they ' d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn ' t star ##ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn ' t be che ##z pan ##isse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
i mean , let ' s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don ' t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it ' s not about chemicals .
it ' s not about our ridic ##ulous passion for horm ##ones , our ins ##isten ##ce on having bigger food , better food , sing ##ular food .
this isn ' t about r ##ice kr ##is ##pie ##s , this is about keeping people alive , and it ' s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don ' t , if we continue to act the way we ' re acting , we ' re gu ##ilt ##y of something that i don ' t think we want to be gu ##ilt ##y of : high - tech colon ##ial ##ism .
there ' s no other way to describe what ' s going on here .
it ' s self ##ish , it ' s ug ##ly , it ' s bene ##ath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amazing ##ly fun conversation , you might want to say , " so , you still want to get in this ridic ##ulous time machine and go forward ? "
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
it ' s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we ' re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we ' re going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i ' m concerned , that ' s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i have been interested in the place ##bo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magic ##ian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , " something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . "
in other words , sugar pill ##s have a meas ##ura ##ble effect in certain kinds of studies , the place ##bo effect , just because the person thinks that what ' s happening to them is a pharm ##ace ##ut ##ical or some sort of a - - for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas ##ura ##ble effect in the body called the place ##bo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of someone ' s perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru ##di ##ment ##ary , very simple magic trick .
and i ' m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that ' s been in every children ' s magic book since at least the 1950 ##s .
i learned it myself from cub sc ##out magic in the 1970 ##s .
i ' ll do it for you , and then i ' ll explain it .
and then i ' ll explain why i explained it .
so , here ' s what happens .
the kn ##ife , which you can exam ##ine ; my hand , which you could exam ##ine .
i ' m just going to hold the kn ##ife in my fis ##t like this .
i ' ll get my sle ##e ##ve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle ##e ##ve i ' m just going to sque ##e ##ze my wr ##ist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i ' m sque ##e ##zing there nothing can go up or down my sle ##e ##ve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i ' m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magnet ##ism will hold the kn ##ife .
in fact it ' s held so t ##ightly in place that i can shake it , and the kn ##ife does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle ##e ##ve , no trick ##ery . and you can exam ##ine everything .
ta - da !
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about dec ##ep ##t ##ion by studying this very - - even though it ' s a very simple trick method ##ological ##ly .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
i hold the kn ##ife in my hand .
i say i ' m going to grab hold of my wr ##ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle ##e ##ve , that is a lie .
the reason i ' m holding onto my wr ##ist is because that ' s actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde ##x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position point ##ing out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn ' t have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as i move around my finger shift ##s .
and we could talk about why this is dec ##ep ##t ##ive , why you don ' t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn ' t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that ' s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it ' s clin ##ging there , not by animal magnet ##ism , but by chic ##ane ##ry , my inde ##x finger being there .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of cover ##s the moving back of my finger .
i take this hand away . you give the kn ##ife out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the place ##bo effect ?
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble ##w my mind wide open .
i ' m not a doctor or a research ##er , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
it turns out that if you administ ##er a place ##bo in the form of a white pill , that ' s like asp ##ir ##in shaped - - it ' s just a round white pill - - it has some certain meas ##ura ##ble effect .
but if you change the form that you give the place ##bo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stam ##p a letter into it , it is actually meas ##ura ##bly more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any pharm ##ace ##ut ##ical - - they ' re sugar pill ##s .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really flip ##ped me out .
turns out though , that that ' s not even where it stop ##s .
if you have cap ##s ##ules , they ' re more effective than table ##ts in any form .
a color ##ed cap ##s ##ule , that ' s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap ##s ##ule .
do ##sa ##ge has something to do with this .
one pill twice a day is not as good at three pill ##s - - i don ' t remember the statist ##ic now . sorry .
but the point is . . .
. . . these do ##sa ##ges have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in place ##bo , you ' ve go to the need ##le .
right ? a sy ##ring ##e with some ine ##rt - - a couple c ##c ##s of some ine ##rt something , and you inj ##ect this into a patient . . .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it ' s so much stronger than the white pill .
it ' s a really , this graph , well i ' ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the cap ##s ##ule is not as good as the need ##le .
and none of it has any real pharm ##ace ##ut ##ical quality , it ' s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need ##le .
this is a seven - inc ##h hat ##p ##in . it ' s very , very shar ##p , and i ' m going to just ster ##il ##ize it a tiny bit .
this is really my fle ##sh . this is not dam ##ian ' s special - grown fle ##sh .
that ' s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
i ' m going to pier ##ce my skin and run this need ##le through to the other side .
if you ' re que ##as ##y - - if you fa ##int easily - - i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn ' t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , i suggest if you get que ##as ##y easy that you look away for about the next 30 - - in fact , you know what , i ' ll do the first bad part behind it .
you ' ll get to see , you can look away too if you ' d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fle ##sh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pier ##ce .
i ' m sorry , man . am i fre ##aking you out ?
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we ' re in the same position we were in with the kn ##ife trick .
sort of .
but you can ' t count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that ' s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well . . .
i know what people think when they see this .
they go , " well , he ' s certainly not dum ##b enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little pe ##ek .
how ' s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back go , " ok , i didn ' t really see that . "
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
that ' s my fle ##sh , and i can tw ##ist that around .
i ' m sorry . if you ' re getting que ##as ##y , look away , don ' t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , " well yeah , that looks kind of ne ##at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be - - see there ' s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble ##ed ##ing .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , i would take the need ##le out .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wo ##und ##s .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i ' m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i hope you ' re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with " happiness " in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness co ##ach ##ing .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in sp ##ite of all this flo ##od of work , there are several cognitive tra ##ps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tra ##ps .
this appl ##ies to lay ##pe ##op ##le thinking about their own happiness , and it appl ##ies to scho ##la ##r ##s thinking about happiness , because it turns out we ' re just as mess ##ed up as anybody else is .
the first of these tra ##ps is a rel ##uc ##t ##ance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word " happiness " is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might rest ##ric ##t it , but by and large , this is something that we ' ll have to give up and we ' ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well - being is .
the second tra ##p is a conf ##usion between experience and memory ; basically , it ' s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they ' re both lu ##mp ##ed in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focus ##ing illusion , and it ' s the unfort ##unate fact that we can ' t think about any circumst ##ance that affect ##s well - being without dist ##ort ##ing its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra ##p .
there ' s just no way of getting it right .
now , i ' d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question - and - answer session after one of my lecture ##s report ##ed a story , and that was a story - - he said he ' d been listening to a symph ##ony , and it was absolutely glo ##ri ##ous music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dre ##ad ##ful scre ##ech ##ing sound .
and then he added , really quite emotional ##ly , it ru ##ined the whole experience .
but it hadn ' t .
what it had ru ##ined were the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of glo ##ri ##ous music .
they count ##ed for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru ##ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two sel ##ves .
there is an experien ##cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re - living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it ' s the experien ##cing self that the doctor approach ##es - - you know , when the doctor asks , " does it hurt now when i touch you here ? "
and then there is a remember ##ing self , and the remember ##ing self is the one that keeps score , and maint ##ains the story of our life , and it ' s the one that the doctor approach ##es in asking the question , " how have you been feeling late ##ly ? "
or " how was your trip to alb ##ania ? " or something like that .
those are two very different ent ##ities , the experien ##cing self and the remember ##ing self , and getting conf ##used between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remember ##ing self is a storyte ##ller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories - - it starts immediately .
we don ' t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients under ##go ##ing a painful proced ##ure .
i won ' t go into detail . it ' s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990 ##s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients , those are their recording ##s .
and you are asked , " who of them suffer ##ed more ? "
and it ' s a very easy question .
clearly , patient b suffer ##ed more - - his colon ##osc ##opy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but now there is another question : " how much did these patients think they suffer ##ed ? "
and here is a surprise .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colon ##osc ##opy than patient b .
the stories of the colon ##osc ##op ##ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great - - but one of them is this dist ##inct . . .
but one of them is dist ##inct ##ly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it ' s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colon ##osc ##opy , and much later , too , " how bad was the whole thing , in total ? "
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experien ##cing self and the remember ##ing self .
from the point of view of the experien ##cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work - - you could actually extend the colon ##osc ##opy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j ##ig ##gling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experien ##cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remember ##ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have end ##ow ##ed patient a with a better story about his experience .
what define ##s a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory deliver ##s for us , and it ' s also true of the stories that we make up .
what define ##s a story are changes , significant moments and end ##ings .
end ##ings are very , very important and , in this case , the end ##ing domin ##ated .
now , the experien ##cing self lives its life continu ##ously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really straight ##for ##ward : they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life - - and i calcul ##ated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600 , 000 - - most of them don ' t leave a tra ##ce .
most of them are completely ignor ##ed by the remember ##ing self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it ' s the fin ##ite resource that we ' re spending while we ' re on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remember ##ing self keeps for us .
so we have the remember ##ing self and the experien ##cing self , and they ' re really quite dist ##inct .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand ##ling of time .
from the point of view of the experien ##cing self , if you have a vac ##ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two - week vac ##ation is twice as good as the one - week vac ##ation .
that ' s not the way it works at all for the remember ##ing self .
for the remember ##ing self , a two - week vac ##ation is bare ##ly better than the one - week vac ##ation because there are no new memories added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari ##able that dist ##ingu ##ish ##es a remember ##ing self from an experien ##cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the remember ##ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon ##osc ##op ##ies with two different surgeon ##s and is dec ##iding which of them to choose , then the one that choose ##s is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that ' s the surgeon that will be chose ##n .
the experien ##cing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don ' t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don ' t think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anti ##ci ##pa ##ted memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty ##ra ##n ##ny of the remember ##ing self , and you can think of the remember ##ing self sort of drag ##ging the experien ##cing self through experiences that the experien ##cing self doesn ' t need .
i have that sense that when we go on vac ##ations this is very frequen ##t ##ly the case ; that is , we go on vac ##ations , to a very large ext ##ent , in the service of our remember ##ing self .
and this is a bit hard to just ##ify i think .
i mean , how much do we consum ##e our memories ?
that is one of the explanation ##s that is given for the domin ##ance of the remember ##ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac ##ation we had in antar ##ctic ##a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac ##ation i ' ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vac ##ations .
and i probably have consum ##ed my memories of that three - week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the fold ##er with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a disc ##re ##pan ##cy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little app ##et ##ite i have for consum ##ing memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen ##u ##ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next vac ##ation , you know that at the end of the vac ##ation all your pictures will be destroy ##ed , and you ' ll get an am ##nes ##ic drug so that you won ' t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac ##ation ?
and if you would choose a different vac ##ation , there is a conflict between your two sel ##ves , and you need to think about how to adj ##ud ##icate that conflict , and it ' s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vac ##ations we do is a problem that conf ##ron ##ts us with a choice between the two sel ##ves .
now , the two sel ##ves bring up two notion ##s of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experien ##cing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experien ##cing self ' s life ?
and they ' re all - - happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experien ##cing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the remember ##ing self , it ' s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ ##ily a person lives .
it is about how satisf ##ied or please ##d the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn ' t dist ##ingu ##ish those notion ##s is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i belong to a crowd of students of well - being , who ' ve been mess ##ing up the study of happiness for a long time in precise ##ly this way .
the dist ##inction between the happiness of the experien ##cing self and the satisf ##action of the remember ##ing self has been recognize ##d in recent years , and there are now effort ##s to measure the two separate ##ly .
the gall ##up organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other effort ##s along those lines .
so in recent years , we have beg ##un to learn about the happiness of the two sel ##ves .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satisf ##ied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn ' t teach you much about how happ ##ily they ' re living their life , and vi ##ce vers ##a .
just to give you a sense of the correl ##ation , the correl ##ation is about . 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , " oh his father is six feet tall , " how much would you know about his height ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there ' s a lot of uncertain ##ty .
you have that much uncertain ##ty .
if i tell you that somebody ran ##ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertain ##ty about how happy they are with their experien ##cing self .
so the correl ##ation is low .
we know something about what control ##s satisf ##action of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main ##ly being satisf ##ied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure ##s , but this is domin ##ant .
so if you want to maxim ##ize the happiness of the two sel ##ves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i ' ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a subst ##it ##ute for well - being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not att ##end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california if , say , you live in oh ##io .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experien ##cing self and it ' s not even very important to the refle ##ctive self that decide ##s how happy people are .
but now , because the refle ##ctive self is in charge , you may end up - - some people may end up moving to california .
and it ' s sort of interesting to tra ##ce what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
well , their experien ##cing self is not going to get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they ' ll be remind ##ed of how horrible the weather was in oh ##io , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well - being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i ' ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gall ##up survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
daniel ka ##hne ##man : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall ##up survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experien ##cing self .
when we looked at how feelings , var ##y with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60 , 000 dollars a year , for americans - - and that ' s a very large sample of americans , like 600 , 000 , so it ' s a large represent ##ative sample - - below an income of 600 , 000 dollars a year . . .
60 , 000 .
d ##k : 60 , 000 .
60 , 000 dollars a year , people are un ##ha ##ppy , and they get progress ##ively un ##ha ##pp ##ier the poor ##er they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean i ' ve rare ##ly seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experien ##t ##ial happiness , but lack of money certainly buy ##s you mis ##ery , and we can measure that mis ##ery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the remember ##ing self , you get a different story .
the more money you earn , the more satisf ##ied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but dann ##y , the whole american ende ##avor is about life , liber ##ty , the purs ##uit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up ##side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax ##ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
d ##k : you know i think that there is recogn ##ition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recogn ##ition is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u . k . , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recogn ##izing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it ' s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev ##al ##ua ##t ##ion , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
how to en ##han ##ce happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remember ##ing self or you think of the experien ##cing self .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , effort ##s are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will - - or at least should be - - the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for invent ##ing behavioral economics .
thank you , dann ##y ka ##hne ##man .
i ' m jane mc ##go ##n ##ig ##al . i ' m a game designer .
i ' ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , i have a plan for this , and it ent ##ails convin ##cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , " that ' s a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , consider ##ing how many ur ##gen ##t problems we have to solve in the real world . "
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it ' s actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world ' s most ur ##gen ##t problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
i ' ve calcul ##ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that ' s probably a bit of a counter ##int ##uit ##ive idea , so i ' ll say it again , let it sin ##k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , i believe that we need to asp ##ire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . i ' m serious . i am .
here ' s why . this picture pretty much sum ##s up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portrait by a photograph ##er named phil to ##led ##an ##o .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gam ##ing , so he set up a camera in front of game ##r ##s while they were playing .
and this is a classic gam ##ing emotion .
now , if you ' re not a game ##r , you might miss some of the nu ##ance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of ur ##gency , a little bit of fear , but intense concent ##ration , deep , deep focus on tack ##ling a really difficult problem .
if you are a game ##r , you will notice a few nu ##ances here : the cr ##ink ##le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optim ##ism , and the eye ##br ##ows up is surprise .
this is a game ##r who is on the verg ##e of something called an ep ##ic win .
oh , you ' ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some game ##r ##s among us .
an ep ##ic win is an outcome that is so extraord ##ina ##ri ##ly positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieve ##d it .
it was almost beyond the thr ##esh ##old of imagination .
and when you get there you are shock ##ed to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an ep ##ic win .
this is a game ##r on the verg ##e of an ep ##ic win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem - solve ##r ##s all over the world as we try to tack ##le the obst ##acles of the next century - - the face of someone who , against all odd ##s is on the verg ##e of an ep ##ic win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tack ##le ur ##gen ##t problems .
this is what i call the " i ' m not good at life " face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the " i ' m not good at life " face .
this is a piece of graf ##f ##iti in my old neighborhood in ber ##kel ##e ##y , california , where i did my ph ##d on why we ' re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of game ##r ##s have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i don ' t mean just good as in successful , although that ' s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but i also mean good as in motiv ##ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor ##ate and to cooper ##ate .
and when we ' re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment ' s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we conf ##ron ##t obst ##acles , we often don ' t feel that way .
we feel over ##come , we feel overwhel ##med , we feel anx ##ious , maybe depress ##ed , frustr ##ated or cy ##n ##ical .
we never have those feelings when we ' re playing games , they just don ' t exist in games .
so , that ' s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can ' t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real - world work ?
so , i looked at games like world of war ##craft , which is really the ideal collabor ##ative problem - solving environment .
and i started to notice a few things that make ep ##ic win ##s so possible in online worlds .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war ##craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world - saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it ' s a mission that is perfectly match ##ed with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can ' t achieve .
but it is on the verg ##e of what you ' re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there ' s no une ##mp ##lo ##ym ##ent in world of war ##craft .
there is no sitting around wr ##ing ##ing your hands , there ' s always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collabor ##ators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your ep ##ic mission .
that ' s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our finger ##t ##ips are tons of collabor ##ators .
and also there is this ep ##ic story , this inspiring story of why we ' re there , and what we ' re doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of level ##ing up and plus - one strength , and plus - one intelligence .
we don ' t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i get off this stage i ' m not going to have plus - one speaking , and plus - one crazy idea , plus - 20 crazy idea .
i don ' t get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collabor ##ative online environments like world of war ##craft is that it ' s so satisf ##ying to be on the verg ##e of an ep ##ic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it ' s just better than reality .
so , so far , collective ##ly all the world of war ##craft game ##r ##s have spent 5 . 9 ##3 million years solving the virtual problems of a ##zer ##oth .
now , that ' s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it ' s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5 . 9 ##3 million years ago was when our ear ##lie ##st prim ##ate human ancestors stood up .
that was the first up ##right prim ##ate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we ' re currently invest ##ing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magn ##itude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it ' s also ap ##t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we ' re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evol ##ving to be a more collabor ##ative and heart ##y species .
this is true . i believe this .
so , consider this really interesting statist ##ic ; it was recently published by a research ##er at car ##ne ##gie mel ##lo ##n university : the average young person today in a country with a strong game ##r culture will have spent 10 , 000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
now 10 , 000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states 10 , 0 ##8 ##0 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school gradu ##ation if you have perfect att ##end ##ance .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good game ##r as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read mal ##col ##m glad ##well ' s new book " out ##lier ##s . "
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10 , 000 hour theory of success .
it ' s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10 , 000 hours of effort ##ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virt ##u ##os ##os at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we ' re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virt ##u ##os ##o game ##r ##s .
so , the big question is , " what exactly are game ##r ##s getting so good at ? "
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtual ##ly un ##pre ##ced ##ente ##d human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virt ##u ##os ##o game ##r ##s , 500 million people who are extraord ##ina ##ri ##ly good at something .
and in the next decade we ' re going to have another billion game ##r ##s who are extraord ##ina ##ri ##ly good at whatever that is .
if you don ' t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing cons ##oles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broad ##band internet so that game ##r ##s all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
they expect one billion more game ##r ##s in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1 . 5 billion game ##r ##s .
so , i ' ve started to think about what these games are making us virt ##u ##os ##os at .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur ##gen ##t optim ##ism .
ok , think of this as extreme self - motivation .
ur ##gen ##t optim ##ism is the desire to act immediately to tack ##le an obst ##acle , combined with the belief that we have a reason ##able hope of success .
game ##r ##s always believe that an ep ##ic win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
game ##r ##s don ' t sit around .
game ##r ##s are virt ##u ##os ##os at we ##av ##ing a t ##ight social fabric .
there ' s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they ' ve beat ##en us bad ##ly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they ' ll stay with the game until it ' s over .
and so , playing a game together actually build ##s up bond ##s and trust and cooper ##ation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
bl ##iss ##ful productivity . i love it .
you know there ' s a reason why the average world of war ##craft game ##r plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a half - time job .
it ' s because we know , when we ' re playing a game , that we ' re actually happier working hard than we are rel ##ax ##ing , or hang ##ing out .
we know that we are optim ##ized , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and game ##r ##s are willing to work hard all the time , if they ' re given the right work .
finally : ep ##ic meaning .
game ##r ##s love to be attach ##ed to aw ##e - inspiring mission ##s to human planet ##ary - scale stories .
so , just one bit of tri ##v ##ia that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wik ##i in the world .
second biggest wik ##i in the world , with nearly 80 , 000 article ##s , is the world of war ##craft wik ##i .
five million people use it every month .
they have comp ##iled more information about world of war ##craft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wik ##i in the world .
they are building an ep ##ic story .
they are building an ep ##ic knowledge resource about the world of war ##craft .
okay , so these are four super ##po ##wers that add up to one thing : game ##r ##s are super - empower ##ed , hope ##ful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individual ##ly capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that ' s the problem that i ' m trying to solve .
there ' s an economist named ed ##ward cast ##ron ##ov ##a .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are invest ##ing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , " we ' re witness ##ing what amounts to no less than a mass ex ##od ##us to virtual worlds and online game environments . "
and he ' s an economist . so , he ' s rational .
and he says . . .
not like me - - i ' m a game designer ; i ' m ex ##ube ##ra ##nt .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because game ##r ##s can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more reward ##ed in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for game ##r ##s to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an optim ##al situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2 , 500 years ago .
these are ancient di ##ce , made out of sheep ' s kn ##uck ##les . right ?
before we had awesome game control ##lers , we had sheep ' s kn ##uck ##les .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you ' re familiar with the work of the ancient gree ##k histor ##ian hero ##do ##t ##us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
hero ##do ##t ##us says that games , particularly di ##ce games , were invented in the kingdom of l ##y ##di ##a during a time of fam ##ine .
appar ##ently , there was such a severe fam ##ine that the king of l ##y ##di ##a decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to hero ##do ##t ##us , they invented di ##ce games and they set up a kingdom - wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so immer ##sed in playing the di ##ce games because games are so engag ##ing , and immer ##se us in such satisf ##ying bl ##iss ##ful productivity , they would ignor ##e the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
and according to hero ##do ##t ##us , they passed 18 years this way , surv ##iving through a fam ##ine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we ' re using games today .
we ' re using games to esc ##ape real - world suffering .
we ' re using games to get away from everything that ' s broken in the real environment , everything that ' s not satisf ##ying about real life , and we ' re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn ' t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to hero ##do ##t ##us , after 18 years the fam ##ine wasn ' t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di ##ce game .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
they played one di ##ce game , and the win ##ners of that game got to go on an ep ##ic advent ##ure .
they would leave l ##y ##di ##a , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thr ##ive .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the et ##rus ##can ##s , who then led to the roman emp ##ire , actually share the same dna as the ancient l ##y ##di ##ans .
and so , recently , scientists have suggest ##ed that hero ##do ##t ##us ' crazy story is actually true .
and ge ##ologists have found evidence of a global cool ##ing that last ##ed for nearly 20 years that could have explained the fam ##ine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , esc ##ap ##ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we ' ve been playing war ##craft since 199 ##4 .
that was the first real - time strategy game from the world of war ##craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played di ##ce games for 18 years , we ' ve been playing war ##craft for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own ep ##ic game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that ' s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of game - play from .
let ' s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real - world problems .
now , i know you ' re asking , " how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? " well , that ' s what i have dev ##ote ##d my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we have this ban ##ner in our office ##s in pal ##o alt ##o , and it express ##es our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the best - case scen ##ario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
we want to imagine ep ##ic win ##s , and then give people the means to achieve the ep ##ic win .
i ' m just going to very brief ##ly show you three games that i ' ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create ep ##ic win ##s in their own future ##s .
so , this is world without oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil short ##age .
the oil short ##age is fiction ##al , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it ' s real , and to live your real life as if we ' ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real - time news , videos , data feed ##s that show you exactly how much oil costs , what ' s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is rio ##ting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we pilot ##ed this game with 1 , 700 players in 2007 , and we ' ve track ##ed them for the three years since .
and i can tell you that this is a transform ##ative experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it ' s good for the world , or because we ' re supposed to .
but if you immer ##se them in an ep ##ic advent ##ure and tell them , " we ' ve run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and advent ##ure for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , " most of our players have kept up the habit ##s that they learned in this game .
so , for the next world - saving game , we decided to a ##im higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
we did a game called super ##stru ##ct at the institute for the future .
and the prem ##ise was a super ##comput ##er has calcul ##ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this super ##comput ##er was called the global extinct ##ion awareness system , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer ##ry bru ##ck ##heimer movie .
you know jer ##ry bru ##ck ##heimer movies , you form a dream team - - you ' ve got the astro ##na ##ut , the scientist , the ex - conv ##ict , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , " everybody ' s on the dream team , and it ' s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . "
we had 8 , 000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 ins ##ane ##ly creative solutions that you can go online , if you google " super ##stru ##ct , " and see .
so , finally , the last game , we ' re launch ##ing it march 3 ##r ##d . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you complete the game you will be ce ##rt ##ified by the world bank institute , as a social innov ##ator , class of 2010 .
working with univers ##ities all over sub - sahara ##n africa , and we are inv ##iting them to learn social innovation skills .
we ' ve got a graph ##ic novel , we ' ve got level ##ing up in skills like local insight , knowledge network ##ing , sustainability , vision and resource ##ful ##ness .
i would like to inv ##ite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter ##pr ##ises to save the world .
so , i ' m going to wra ##p up now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we ' ve got all these amazing game ##r ##s , we ' ve got these games that are kind of pilot ##s of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well i hope that you will agree with me that game ##r ##s are a human resource that we can use to do real - world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing super ##po ##wers : bl ##iss ##ful productivity , the ability to we ##av ##e a t ##ight social fabric , this feeling of ur ##gen ##t optim ##ism and the desire for ep ##ic meaning .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that ' s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , i say : let the world - changing games begin .
thank you .
i ' d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for it ##al ##ian wired .
i always keep my the ##sa ##ur ##us handy whenever i ' m writing anything , but i ' d already finished ed ##iting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word " dis ##able ##d " to see what i ' d find .
let me read you the ent ##ry .
" dis ##able ##d , adj ##ect ##ive : cr ##ipp ##led , help ##less , use ##less , wr ##ec ##ked , sta ##lled , ma ##ime ##d , wo ##unde ##d , man ##gle ##d , lam ##e , mut ##ila ##ted , run - down , wor ##n - out , weak ##ene ##d , imp ##oten ##t , cast ##rate ##d , paraly ##zed , hand ##ica ##pped , sen ##ile , decre ##p ##it , la ##id - up , done - up , done - for , done - in crack ##ed - up , count ##ed - out ; see also hurt , use ##less and weak .
ant ##onym ##s , healthy , strong , capable . "
i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laugh ##ing , it was so lu ##di ##c ##ro ##us , but i ' d just gotten past " man ##gle ##d , " and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the ass ##ault from these words un ##le ##ash ##ed .
you know , of course , this is my ra ##g ##ged ##y old the ##sa ##ur ##us so i ' m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980 ##s , when i would have been starting primary school and form ##ing an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , need ##less to say , thank god i wasn ' t using a the ##sa ##ur ##us back then .
i mean , from this ent ##ry , it would seem that i was born into a world that perce ##ived someone like me to have nothing positive what ##so ##ever going for them , when in fact , today i ' m celebrate ##d for the opportunities and advent ##ures my life has pro ##c ##ured .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online ed ##ition , expect ##ing to find a rev ##ision worth not ##ing .
here ' s the up ##da ##ted version of this ent ##ry .
unfortunately , it ' s not much better .
i find the last two words under " near ant ##onym ##s , " particularly uns ##ett ##ling : " whole " and " whole ##so ##me . "
so , it ' s not just about the words .
it ' s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it ' s about the values behind the words , and how we constru ##ct those values .
our language affect ##s our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the gree ##ks and the roman ##s , believed that to ut ##ter a cur ##se verb ##ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who ' s empower ##ed ?
by cas ##ually doing something as simple as nam ##ing a person , a child , we might be putting li ##ds and cast ##ing shad ##ows on their power .
wouldn ' t we want to open door ##s for them instead ?
one such person who opened door ##s for me was my childhood doctor at the a . i . du ##po ##nt institute in wil ##ming ##ton , del ##aw ##are .
his name was dr . pizz ##ut ##ill ##o , an it ##al ##ian american , whose name , appar ##ently , was too difficult for most americans to pro ##no ##un ##ce , so he went by dr . p .
and dr . p always wor ##e really color ##ful bow tie ##s and had the very perfect disp ##osition to work with children .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the except ##ion of my physical therapy session ##s .
i had to do what seemed like inn ##ume ##rab ##le repe ##t ##itions of exercise ##s with these thick , el ##ast ##ic band ##s - - different colors , you know - - to help build up my leg muscle ##s , and i hate ##d these band ##s more than anything - - i hate ##d them , had names for them . i hate ##d them .
and , you know , i was already bar ##ga ##ining , as a five year - old child , with dr . p to try to get out of doing these exercise ##s , uns ##uc ##cess ##fully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session - - ex ##haus ##t ##ive and unf ##or ##g ##iving , these session ##s - - and he said to me , " wow . a ##ime ##e , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you ' re going to break one of those band ##s .
when you do break it , i ' m going to give you a hundred buck ##s . "
now , of course , this was a simple pl ##oy on dr . p ' s part to get me to do the exercise ##s i didn ' t want to do before the pros ##pect of being the rich ##est five - year - old in the second floor war ##d , but what he effectively did for me was res ##ha ##pe an awful daily occur ##ren ##ce into a new and prom ##ising experience for me .
and i have to wonder today to what ext ##ent his vision and his dec ##la ##ration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inher ##ently strong , powerful and ath ##let ##ic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in position ##s of power can ign ##ite the power of a child .
but , in the previous instance ##s of those the ##sa ##ur ##us ent ##ries , our language isn ' t allowing us to evol ##ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn ' t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical stand ##point , my legs , laser surgery for vision imp ##air ##ment , titan ##ium knee ##s and hip replace ##ments for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their ab ##ilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imp ##osed on them - - not to mention social network ##ing platform ##s allow people to self - identify , to claim their own descri ##ption ##s of themselves , so they can go al ##ign with global groups of their own cho ##osing .
so , perhaps technology is reve ##aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest ass ##et .
the human ability to adapt , it ' s an interesting thing , because people have continu ##ally wanted to talk to me about over ##com ##ing adv ##ers ##ity , and i ' m going to make an adm ##ission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt une ##as ##y trying to answer people ' s questions about it , and i think i ' m starting to figure out why .
implic ##it in this phrase of " over ##com ##ing adv ##ers ##ity " is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience uns ##ca ##the ##d or un ##mark ##ed by the experience , as if my success ##es in life have come about from an ability to sides ##te ##p or circum ##na ##v ##ig ##ate the pres ##ume ##d p ##it ##falls of a life with prosth ##etic ##s , or what other people perce ##ive as my dis ##ability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marke ##d , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotional ##ly or both .
and i ' m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adv ##ers ##ity isn ' t an obst ##acle that we need to get around in order to res ##ume living our life .
it ' s part of our life .
and i tend to think of it like my shad ##ow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there ' s very little , but it ' s always with me .
and , certainly , i ' m not trying to di ##min ##ish the impact , the weight , of a person ' s struggle .
there is adv ##ers ##ity and challenge in life , and it ' s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn ' t whether or not you ' re going to meet adv ##ers ##ity , but how you ' re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply sh ##ield ##ing those we care for from adv ##ers ##ity , but prepar ##ing them to meet it well .
and we do a diss ##er ##v ##ice to our kids when we make them feel that they ' re not equip ##ped to adapt .
there ' s an important difference and dist ##inction between the object ##ive medical fact of my being an amp ##ute ##e and the subject ##ive soc ##iet ##al opinion of whether or not i ' m dis ##able ##d .
and , truth ##fully , the only real and cons ##istent dis ##ability i ' ve had to conf ##ron ##t is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definition ##s .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro ##gn ##osis , or , indeed , a pro ##gn ##osis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don ' t put the first br ##ick in a wall that will actually dis ##able someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serve ##s to be more dis ##abl ##ing to the individual than the path ##ology itself .
by not treating the whole ##ness of a person , by not ack ##no ##w ##led ##ging their poten ##cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively grad ##ing someone ' s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the path ##ology and into the range of human cap ##ability .
and , most importantly , there ' s a partnership between those perce ##ived def ##ic ##ien ##cies and our greatest creative ability .
so it ' s not about dev ##al ##uing , or neg ##ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe ##ep under the ru ##g , but instead to find those opportunities wra ##pped in the adv ##ers ##ity .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over ##com ##ing adv ##ers ##ity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embra ##cing it , gra ##pp ##ling with it , to use a wr ##est ##ling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adv ##ers ##ity as natural , cons ##istent and useful , we ' re less bur ##den ##ed by the presence of it .
this year we celebrate the 200 ##th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustr ##ated , i think , a truth about the human character .
to par ##ap ##hr ##ase : it ' s not the strong ##est of the species that survive ##s , nor is it the most intelligent that survive ##s ; it is the one that is most adapt ##able to change .
conflict is the genes ##is of creation .
from darwin ' s work , among ##st others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flo ##ur ##ish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adapt ##ation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we ' re tested , we don ' t know what we ' re made of .
maybe that ' s what adv ##ers ##ity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re - imagine adv ##ers ##ity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
adv ##ers ##ity is just change that we haven ' t adapt ##ed ourselves to yet .
i think the greatest adv ##ers ##ity that we ' ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal ##cy .
now , who ' s normal ?
there ' s no normal .
there ' s common , there ' s typical . there ' s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
i don ' t think so .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achie ##ving normal ##cy to one of possibility - - or poten ##cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous - - we can release the power of so many more children , and inv ##ite them to engage their rare and valuable ab ##ilities with the community .
anthrop ##ologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contrib ##ute .
there ' s evidence that neanderth ##als , 60 , 000 years ago , carried their elder ##ly and those with serious physical inj ##ury , and perhaps it ' s because the life experience of survival of these people prove ##d of value to the community .
they didn ' t view these people as broken and use ##less ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in north ##e ##aster ##n penn ##sy ##lv ##ania , and i was standing over a bush ##el of tom ##at ##oes .
it was summer ##time : i had short ##s on .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , " well , if it isn ' t a ##ime ##e mu ##ll ##ins . "
and i turn around , and it ' s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , " i ' m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don ' t remember meeting you . "
he said , " well , you wouldn ' t remember meeting me .
i mean , when we met i was deliver ##ing you from your mother ' s wom ##b . "
oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was dr . ke ##an , a man that i had only known about through my mother ' s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
and so my mother ' s pre ##na ##t ##al physic ##ian had gone on vac ##ation , so the man who deliver ##ed me was a complete strange ##r to my parents .
and , because i was born without the fi ##bu ##la bones , and had feet turned in , and a few to ##es in this foot and a few to ##es in that , he had to be the bear ##er - - this strange ##r had to be the bear ##er of bad news .
he said to me , " i had to give this pro ##gn ##osis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobil ##ity that other kids have or any kind of life of independ ##ence , and you ' ve been making li ##ar out of me ever since . "
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clip ##ping ##s throughout my whole childhood , whether win ##ning a second grade spe ##lling bee , march ##ing with the girl sc ##out ##s , you know , the hallo ##ween parad ##e , win ##ning my college scho ##la ##r ##sh ##ip , or any of my sport ##s vict ##ories , and he was using it , and integr ##ating it into teaching res ##ident students , med students from ha ##hne ##mann medical school and her ##sh ##e ##y medical school .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
no pro ##gn ##osis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin ##ant in the quality of someone ' s life .
and dr . ke ##an went on to tell me , he said , " in my experience , unless repe ##ated ##ly told otherwise , and even if given a mod ##ic ##um of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . "
see , dr . ke ##an made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there ' s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there ' s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have trade ##d prosth ##etic ##s for fle ##sh - and - bone legs , i wouldn ' t have he ##s ##ita ##ted for a second .
i asp ##ired to that kind of normal ##cy back then .
but if you ask me today , i ' m not so sure .
and it ' s because of the experiences i ' ve had with them , not in sp ##ite of the experiences i ' ve had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i ' ve been exp ##osed to more people who have opened door ##s for me than those who have put li ##ds and cast shad ##ows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the ep ##ip ##han ##y of your own power , and you ' re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power - - the human spirit is so rece ##pt ##ive - - if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru ##cial moment , you are educ ##ating them in the best sense .
you ' re teaching them to open door ##s for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word " educ ##ate " comes from the root word " educ ##e . "
it means " to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . "
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 1960 ##s britain , when they were moving from gramm ##ar schools to comp ##rehen ##s ##ive schools .
it ' s called the stream ##ing trials . we call it " tracking " here in the states .
it ' s separ ##ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and the " a students " get the tough ##er curr ##ic ##ul ##um , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three - month period , d - level students , gave them a ' s , told them they were " a ' s , " told them they were bright , and at the end of this three - month period , they were performing at a - level .
and , of course , the heart ##bre ##aking , flip side of this study , is that they took the " a students " and told them they were " d ' s . "
and that ' s what happened at the end of that three - month period .
those who were still around in school , bes ##ides the people who had dropped out .
a cru ##cial part of this case study was that the teachers were du ##ped too .
the teachers didn ' t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , " these are the ' a - students , ' these are the ' d - students . ' " and that ' s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , i think that the only true dis ##ability is a cru ##sh ##ed spirit , a spirit that ' s been cru ##sh ##ed doesn ' t have hope , it doesn ' t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child ##like curiosity and our inn ##ate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can bol ##ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imag ##ina ##t ##ive , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qual ##ities , we are able to create new real ##ities and new ways of being .
i ' d like to leave you with a poem by a four ##te ##enth - century pers ##ian poet named ha ##f ##iz that my friend , jac ##ques dem ##bo ##is told me about , and the poem is called " the god who only knows four words " : " every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don ' ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repe ##ating them , saying , ' come dance with me .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . ' " thank you .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory - - more precise , more accurate and quick ##er .
or maybe you ' d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stam ##ina .
would you like to be more attract ##ive and self - conf ##ident ?
how about living longer with good health ?
or perhaps you ' re one of those who ' s always year ##ne ##d for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that ' s very good .
how many would opt for memory ?
quite a few more .
how about fit ##ness ?
a few less .
what about long ##e ##vit ##y ?
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
is it just imag ##inary ?
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
evolution has been a per ##enn ##ial topic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor ' s take on the subject .
the great 20th - century genetic ##ist , t . g . do ##b ##z ##han ##sk ##y , who was also a communic ##ant in the russia ##n ort ##ho ##do ##x church , once wrote an ess ##ay that he title ##d " nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . "
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communication ##s device - - i give you per ##mission - - and perhaps take another look at kath ##ry ##n schul ##tz ' s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what ##so ##ever to you .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i ' ve put a bush with a center bran ##ching out in all directions , because if you look at the edge ##s of the tree of life , every existing species at the t ##ips of those bran ##ches has succeed ##ed in evolutionary terms : it has survive ##d ; it has demonstr ##ated a fit ##ness to its environment .
the human part of this bran ##ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
we bran ##ch off of a common ancest ##or to modern chimpanze ##es about six or eight million years ago .
in the interv ##al , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom ##ini ##ds .
some have come and gone .
we have been here for about 130 , 000 years .
it may seem like we ' re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machine ##ry of our cells is pretty much the same .
do you realize that we can take advantage and command ##e ##er the machine ##ry of a common bacter ##ium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabet ##ics ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemical ##ly ind ##ist ##ingu ##ish ##able from what comes out of your pan ##c ##re ##as .
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us car ##ries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean think of it , when ant ##on ##io dam ##as ##io asks about your self - image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful ##ly hosp ##ita ##ble environment for those bacteria .
it ' s warm , it ' s dark , it ' s mo ##ist , it ' s very co ##zy .
and you ' re going to provide all the nutr ##ition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
it ' s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the occasion ##al inter ##ruption of the uni ##nten ##ded forced rush to the ex ##it .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
they help in the dig ##est ##ion of essential nutr ##ients , and they protect you against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we at some kind of evolutionary equip ##o ##ise as a species ?
or , are we dest ##ined to become something different - - something , perhaps , even better adapt ##ed to the environment ?
now let ' s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago - - the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years - - the first signs of proto - life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth - - the first multi - cell ##ed organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago - - and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130 , 000 years .
in this vast unf ##ini ##sh ##ed symph ##ony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small grace note .
that was us .
that also const ##it ##utes the entertainment port ##ion of this talk , so i hope you enjoy ##ed it .
now when i was a fresh ##man in college , i took my first biology class .
i was fascin ##ated by the ele ##gan ##ce and beauty of biology .
i became en ##am ##ored of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single - cell ##ed organisms , each cell simply divide ##s , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells .
but at the time multi - cell ##ed organisms come online , things start to change .
sexual reprodu ##ction enter ##s the picture .
and very importantly , with the introdu ##ction of sexual reprodu ##ction that pass ##es on the genome , the rest of the body becomes exp ##end ##able .
in fact , you could say that the inevit ##ability of the death of our bodies enter ##s in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reprodu ##ction .
now i have to conf ##ess , when i was a college under ##grad ##ua ##te , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex - - it seemed pretty reason ##able at the time , but with each pass ##ing year , i ' ve come to have increasing doubt ##s .
i ' ve come to understand the sent ##iment ##s of george burn ##s , who was performing still in las ve ##gas well into his 90 ##s .
and one night , there ' s a knock at his hotel room door .
he answers the door .
standing before him is a go ##r ##ge ##ous , scan ##t ##ily cla ##d show ##g ##ir ##l .
she looks at him and says , " i ' m here for super sex . "
" that ' s fine , " says george , " i ' ll take the sou ##p . "
i came to realize , as a physic ##ian , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution - - not necessarily contra ##di ##ctor ##y , just different .
i was trying to preser ##ve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to rest ##ore health from disease .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about pass ##ing on the genome to the next generation , adapt ##ing and surv ##iving through generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the boo ##ster rocket ##s designed to send the genetic pay ##load into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea .
i think we would all understand the sent ##iment that wood ##y allen express ##ed when he said , " i don ' t want to achieve imm ##ort ##ality through my work .
i want to achieve it through not dying . "
evolution does not necessarily favor the long ##est - lived .
it doesn ' t necessarily favor the biggest or the strong ##est or the fast ##est , and not even the smart ##est .
evolution favor ##s those creatures best adapt ##ed to their environment .
that is the sol ##e test of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther ##mo ##ph ##il ##ic and can survive at the ste ##am vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sou ##s - vide cook ##ed fish , never ##the ##less , have managed to make that a hosp ##ita ##ble environment for them .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we will not evol ##ve .
we have reached a kind of equip ##o ##ise .
and the reason ##ing behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preser ##ve a lot of genes that would otherwise be sele ##cted out and be remove ##d from the population .
and second ##ly , we as a species have so conf ##ig ##ured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it .
and by the way , we imm ##ig ##rate and circ ##ulate and inter ##mi ##x so much that you can ' t any longer have the isol ##ation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imp ##osed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the wheel ##s of evolution gr ##ind slowly , but they are ine ##x ##ora ##ble .
and as far as isol ##ation goes , when we as a species do colon ##ize distant planets , there will be the isol ##ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
but there ' s a third possibility , an ent ##icing , intr ##ig ##uing and frighten ##ing possibility .
i call it ne ##o - evolution - - the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guide ##d and chose ##n by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
now how could this come about ?
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their off ##spr ##ing .
they ' re , in some cultures , cho ##osing to have more male ##s than female ##s .
it ' s not necessarily good for the society , but it ' s what the individual and the family are cho ##osing .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjust ##ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
what if you could make the genetic changes to elimin ##ate diabetes or alzheimer ' s or reduce the risk of cancer or elimin ##ate stro ##ke ?
wouldn ' t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2 . 7 billion dollars .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pair ##s in the human genome at a cost of about 20 , 000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
it won ' t be very long before the reality will be the 1 , 000 - dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
just a week ago , the national academ ##y of engineering aw ##ard ##ed its dra ##per prize to francis ar ##no ##ld and will ##em stem ##mer , two scientists who independent ##ly developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des ##ir ##able proteins in a more efficient way - - what france ##s ar ##no ##ld calls " direct ##ed evolution . "
a couple of years ago , the las ##ker prize was aw ##ard ##ed to the scientist sh ##in ##ya y ##ama ##na ##ka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi ##br ##ob ##la ##st , and by manipul ##ating just four genes , he ind ##uc ##ed that cell to reve ##rt to a pl ##ur ##ip ##oten ##t ##ial stem cell - - a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but ind ##uc ##e immun ##ity against other viruses .
believe it or not , there ' s an experiment ##al trial going on with vaccine against influen ##z ##a that has been grown in the cells of a to ##ba ##cc ##o plant .
can you imagine something good coming out of to ##ba ##cc ##o ?
these are all reality today , and [ in ] the future , will be ever ##more possible .
imagine then just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off ##spr ##ing ?
what if you could change the sper ##m and the o ##va , or change the new ##ly fert ##il ##ized eg ##g , and give your off ##spr ##ing a better chance at a health ##ier life - - elimin ##ate the diabetes , elimin ##ate the hem ##oph ##il ##ia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn ' t want health ##ier children ?
and then , that same analy ##t ##ic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super - att ##ribute ##s , hyper - capac ##ities - - that better memory .
why not have the quick wit of a ken jen ##ning ##s , especially if you can aug ##ment it with the next generation of the wa ##ts ##on machine ?
why not have the quick tw ##itch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these will be irre ##s ##ist ##ible .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the att ##ribute ##s we want , we will have conver ##ted old - style evolution into ne ##o - evolution .
we ' ll take a process that normally might require 100 , 000 years , and we can comp ##ress it down to a thousand years - - and maybe even in the next 100 years .
these are choices that your grand ##ch ##ild ##ren , or their grand ##ch ##ild ##ren , are going to have before them .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
or , will we sele ##ctive ##ly choose different att ##ribute ##s that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
will we make a society that is more boring and more uni ##form , or more robust and more vers ##ati ##le ?
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and most profound ##ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inher ##it the wisdom , that we ' ll need to make these choices wise ##ly ?
for better or worse , and soon ##er than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
thank you .
i want you now to imagine a wear ##able robot that gives you super ##h ##um ##an ab ##ilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
we at ber ##kel ##e ##y bio ##n ##ics call these robots ex ##os ##kel ##et ##ons .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further en ##han ##ce your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
it is actually the true integr ##ation of the man and the machine .
but not only that - - it will integr ##ate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american sold ##ier , that on average does carry about 100 l ##bs . on their back ##s , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
obviously , this is result ##ing in some major complic ##ations - - back inj ##uries , 30 percent of them - - chr ##onic back inj ##uries .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex ##os ##kel ##et ##on that would help deal with this issue .
so let me now introduce to you hu ##l ##c - - or the human universal load car ##rie ##r .
with the hu ##l ##c ex ##os ##kel ##et ##on , i can carry 200 l ##bs . over vari ##ed terr ##ain for many hours .
its flexible design allows for deep squ ##ats , cra ##w ##ls and high - ag ##ility movements .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then aug ##ments my strength and end ##urance .
we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new ex ##os ##kel ##et ##on this year .
so this is for real .
now let ' s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users , something that i ' m particularly passionate about .
there are 6 ##8 million people estim ##ated to be in wheelchair ##s worldwide .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that ' s actually a conserv ##ative estim ##ate .
we are talking here about , often ##time ##s , very young individuals with spin ##al cor ##d inj ##uries , that in the prime of their life - - 20 ##s , 30 ##s , 40 ##s - - hit a wall and the wheelchair ' s the only option .
but it is also the aging population that is multipl ##ying in numbers .
and the only option , pretty much - - when it ' s stro ##ke or other complic ##ations - - is the wheelchair .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introdu ##ction , i must say .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobil ##ity .
let me now introduce you to ele ##gs that is wor ##n by am ##anda box ##tel that 19 years ago was spin ##al cor ##d inj ##ured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
thank you .
am ##anda is wearing our ele ##gs set .
it has sensor ##s .
it ' s completely non - inv ##as ##ive , sensor ##s in the cru ##t ##ches that send signals back to our on ##board computer that is sitting here at her back .
there are battery pack ##s here as well that power motor ##s that are sitting at her hip ##s , as well as her knee join ##ts , that move her forward in this kind of sm ##ooth and very natural ga ##it .
i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre ##ak summer ##sa ##ult while down ##hil ##l ski ##ing paraly ##zed me .
in a split second , i lost all sens ##ation and movement below my pe ##lv ##is .
not long after ##wards , a doctor stro ##de into my hospital room , and he said , " am ##anda , you ' ll never walk again . "
and that was 19 ye ##as ago .
he rob ##bed every o ##un ##ce of hope from my being .
adapt ##ive technology has since enable ##d me to learn how to down ##hil ##l ski again , to rock climb and even hand ##cy ##cle .
but nothing has been invented that enable ##s me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platform ##s to sit down and have discussion ##s with you .
it ' s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations - - not only for the soldiers , or for am ##anda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
thanks .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non - profit called rob ##in ho ##od .
when i ' m not fighting poverty , i ' m fighting fire ##s as the assist ##ant capt ##ain of a volunte ##er fire company .
now in our town , where the volunte ##ers supp ##lement a highly skill ##ed career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte ##er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
but still it was a real foot ##ra ##ce against the other volunte ##ers to get to the capt ##ain in charge to find out what our assign ##ments would be .
when i found the capt ##ain , he was having a very engag ##ing conversation with the home ##own ##er , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pour ##ing rain , under an um ##bre ##ll ##a , in her pa ##ja ##mas , bare ##f ##oot , while her house was in fl ##ames .
the other volunte ##er who had arrived just before me - - let ' s call him le ##x lu ##ther - - got to the capt ##ain first and was asked to go inside and save the home ##own ##er ' s dog .
the dog ! i was stun ##ne ##d with je ##al ##ous ##y .
here was some law ##yer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
well , i was next .
the capt ##ain wave ##d me over .
he said , " bez ##os , i need you to go into the house .
i need you to go up ##sta ##ir ##s , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . "
i swe ##ar .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went - - up the sta ##ir ##s , down the hall , past the ' real ' fire ##fig ##ht ##ers , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedro ##om to get a pair of shoes .
now i know what you ' re thinking , but i ' m no hero .
i carried my pay ##load back down ##sta ##ir ##s where i met my ne ##me ##s ##is and the prec ##ious dog by the front door .
we took our tre ##as ##ures outside to the home ##own ##er , where , not surprising ##ly , his received much more attention than did mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home ##own ##er thank ##ing us for the val ##iant effort display ##ed in saving her home .
the act of kind ##ness she note ##d above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
in both my voc ##ation at rob ##in ho ##od and my av ##oc ##ation as a volunte ##er fire ##fig ##ht ##er , i am witness to acts of gener ##os ##ity and kind ##ness on a mon ##ument ##al scale , but i ' m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
and you know what i ' ve learned ?
they all matter .
so as i look around this room at people who either have achieve ##d , or are on their way to achie ##ving , remarkable levels of success , i would offer this remind ##er : don ' t wait .
don ' t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody ' s life .
if you have something to give , give it now .
serve food at a sou ##p kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
be a ment ##or .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody ' s life , but every day offer ##s us an opportunity to affect one .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that hold ##s the secret to human survival .
it ' s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day - - where fun is serious business .
and no , this isn ' t burning man or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cous ##ins .
this is the world of wild bonob ##os in the jung ##les of congo .
bonob ##os are , together with chimpanze ##es , your living close ##st relative .
that means we all share a common ancest ##or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
now , chimpanze ##es are well - known for their aggress ##ion .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an emp ##ha ##s ##is of this aspect in our narrative ##s of human evolution .
but bonob ##os show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanze ##es are domin ##ated by big , scary guys , bonob ##o society is run by empower ##ed female ##s .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly toler ##ant society where fat ##al violence has not been observ ##ed yet .
but unfortunately , bonob ##os are the least understood of the great ap ##es .
they live in the depth ##s of the congo ##les ##e jung ##le , and it has been very difficult to study them .
the congo is a paradox - - a land of extraordinary biod ##ivers ##ity and beauty , but also the heart of dark ##ness itself - - the scene of a violent conflict that has ra ##ged for decades and claim ##ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
not surprising ##ly , this destruction also end ##anger ##s bonob ##o survival .
bush ##me ##at trade ##s and forest loss means we couldn ' t fill a small stad ##ium with all the bonob ##os that are left in the world - - and we ' re not even sure of that to be honest .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laugh ##ter sw ##ay ##ing the trees .
who are these cous ##ins ?
we know them as the " make love , not war " ap ##es since they have frequen ##t , prom ##is ##c ##u ##ous and bis ##e ##x ##ual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
now , i ' m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity ' s problems - - since there ' s more to bonob ##o life than the kam ##a su ##tr ##a .
bonob ##os , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
play is not just child ' s games .
for us and them , play is foundation ##al for bond ##ing relationships and fo ##ster ##ing toler ##ance .
it ' s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
play increase ##s creativity and resil ##ience , and it ' s all about the generation of diversity - - diversity of interaction ##s , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonob ##o play , you ' re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laugh ##ter , dance and ritual .
play is the gl ##ue that bin ##ds us together .
now , i don ' t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique clip ##s fresh from the wild .
first , it ' s a ball game bonob ##o - style - - and i do not mean football .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a cha ##se game .
have a look what she ' s doing .
it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , " she ' s got him by the ball ##s . "
only i think that he ' s rather lo ##ving it here , right ?
yeah .
so sex play is common in both bonob ##os and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows - - this video ' s really interesting because it shows the invent ##iven ##ess of bringing unusual elements into play - - such as test ##icles - - and also how play both requires trust and fo ##sters trust - - while at the same time being tremendous fun .
but play ' s a shapes ##hi ##fter .
play ' s a shapes ##hi ##fter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imag ##ina ##t ##ive , curious - - maybe where wonder is discovered an ##e ##w .
and i want you to see , this is fu ##k ##u , a young female , and she is quiet ##ly playing with water .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the bound ##aries of our inner and our out ##er worlds .
and it ' s that play ##ful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hot ##bed for creativity .
so these are just small taste ##r ##s into the insight ##s that bonob ##o give us to our past and present .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooper ##ation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capac ##ities .
in other words , play is our adapt ##ive wild ##car ##d .
in order to adapt successful ##ly to a changing world , we need to play .
but will we make the most of our play ##ful ##ness ?
play is not fr ##iv ##ol ##ous .
play ' s essential .
for bonob ##os and humans al ##ike , life is not just red in too ##th and cla ##w .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur ##gen ##t .
and so , my fellow prim ##ates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we red ##is ##cover creativity , fellow ##sh ##ip and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couple ##s in the middle of 197 ##9 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each conc ##e ##iving a baby - - okay ?
so two couple ##s each conc ##e ##iving one baby .
now i don ' t want you to spend too much time imag ##ining the concept ##ion , because if you spend all that time imag ##ining that concept ##ion , you ' re not going to listen to me .
so just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scen ##ario , i want to imagine that , in one case , the sper ##m is carrying a y chromos ##ome , meeting that x chromos ##ome of the eg ##g .
and in the other case , the sper ##m is carrying an x chromos ##ome , meeting the x chromos ##ome of the eg ##g .
both are vi ##able ; both take off .
we ' ll come back to these people later .
so i wear two hat ##s in most of what i do .
as the one hat , i do history of anatom ##y .
i ' m a histor ##ian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have deal ##t with anatom ##y - - meaning human bodies , animal bodies - - how they deal ##t with bo ##di ##ly flu ##ids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i ' ve wor ##n in my work is as an activ ##ist , as a patient adv ##oc ##ate - - or , as i sometimes say , as an imp ##ati ##ent adv ##oc ##ate - - for people who are patients of doctors .
in that case , what i ' ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norm ##s .
so some of what i ' ve worked on , for example , is people who are con ##jo ##ined tw ##ins - - two people within one body .
some of what i ' ve worked on is people who have d ##war ##f ##ism - - so people who are much short ##er than typical .
and a lot of what i ' ve worked on is people who have at ##yp ##ical sex - - so people who don ' t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter ##sex for this .
inter ##sex comes in a lot of different forms .
i ' ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn ' t standard for male or female .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an x ##y chromos ##om ##al basis , and that s ##ry gene on the y chromos ##ome tells the proto - go ##na ##ds , which we all have in the fet ##al life , to become test ##es .
and so in the fet ##al life the test ##es are pump ##ing out test ##ost ##er ##one .
but because this individual lack ##s rece ##pt ##ors to hear that test ##ost ##er ##one , the body doesn ' t react to the test ##ost ##er ##one .
and this is a synd ##rome called and ##rogen inse ##ns ##itiv ##ity synd ##rome .
so lots of levels of test ##ost ##er ##one , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body develop ##s more along the female typical path .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and it ' s often not until she hits pu ##bert ##y and she ' s growing and developing breast ##s , but she ' s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something ' s up here .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o ##va ##ries inside and a ut ##er ##us , she actually has test ##es inside , and she has a y chromos ##ome .
now what ' s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they ' re really not .
female ##s , like male ##s , have in our bodies something called the ad ##ren ##al gl ##and ##s .
they ' re in the back of our body .
and the ad ##ren ##al gl ##and ##s make and ##rogen ##s , which are a mas ##cul ##ini ##zing horm ##one .
most female ##s like me - - i believe myself to be a typical female - - i don ' t actually know my chromos ##om ##al make - up but i think i ' m probably typical - - most female ##s like me are actually and ##rogen - sensitive .
we ' re making and ##rogen , and we ' re respond ##ing to and ##rogen ##s .
the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exp ##osed to more and ##rogen ##s than the woman born with test ##es who has and ##rogen inse ##ns ##itiv ##ity synd ##rome .
so sex is really complicated ; it ' s not just that inter ##sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum - - in some ways , they can be all over the place .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girl ##fr ##ien ##d , had sex with his girl ##fr ##ien ##d , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o ##va ##ries and a ut ##er ##us inside .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con ##gen ##ital ad ##ren ##al hyper ##pl ##as ##ia .
he had x ##x chromos ##omes , and in the wom ##b , his ad ##ren ##al gl ##and ##s were in such high ge ##ar that it created , essentially , a mas ##cul ##ine horm ##ona ##l environment .
and as a consequence , his gen ##itals were mas ##cul ##in ##zed , his brain was subject to the more typical mas ##cul ##ine component of horm ##ones .
and he was born looking like a boy - - nobody susp ##ect ##ed anything .
and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men ##stru ##ating internal ##ly , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female internal ##ly .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter ##sex .
some people who have x ##x chromos ##omes develop what are called o ##vo ##test ##is , which is when you have o ##va ##ria ##n tissue with test ##ic ##ular tissue wra ##pped around it .
and we ' re not exactly sure why that happens .
so sex can come in lots of different vari ##et ##ies .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies - - whether it ' s d ##war ##f ##ism , or it ' s con ##jo ##ined tw ##inning , or it ' s an inter ##sex type - - are often normal ##ized by surgeon ##s is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
the reason they ' re often subject to various kinds of surger ##ies is because they threaten our social categ ##ories .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatom ##y comes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle ##ged ##ly , is to have an african anatom ##y in terms of your history .
and so we have this terr ##ibly simpl ##istic idea .
and when we ' re faced with a body that actually present ##s us something quite different , it start ##les us in terms of those categ ##or ##izations .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individual ##ism .
and our nation ' s really found ##ed on a very romantic concept of individual ##ism .
well you can imagine how start ##ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the south african run ##ner , cast ##er se ##men ##ya , had her sex called into question at the international games in berlin .
i had a lot of journalist ##s calling me , asking me , " which is the test they ' re going to run that will tell us whether or not cast ##er se ##men ##ya is male or female ? "
and i had to explain to the journalist ##s there isn ' t such a test .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn ' t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter ##sex and female and inter ##sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the far ##ther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categ ##ories that we thought of as stab ##le anatom ##ical categ ##ories that map ##ped very simply to stab ##le identity categ ##ories are a lot more fu ##zz ##y than we thought .
and it ' s not just in terms of sex .
it ' s also in terms of race , which turns out to be vast ##ly more complicated than our termin ##ology has allowed .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncom ##fort ##able areas .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze ##es .
what are we to make of the fact that we diff ##er from them only really by a few nu ##cle ##ot ##ides ?
and as we get far ##ther and far ##ther with our science , we get more and more into a disc ##om ##fort ##ed zone where we have to ack ##no ##w ##ledge that the simpl ##istic categ ##ories we ' ve had are probably over ##ly simpl ##istic .
so we ' re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
one of the places we ' re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is battle ##s over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fet ##al life .
we have very difficult conversations now ##ada ##ys - - probably not out in the open as much as within medicine - - about the question of when somebody ' s dead .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
at most , they ' d stick a fe ##ather on somebody ' s nose , and if it tw ##itch ##ed , they didn ' t bur ##y them yet .
if it stopped tw ##itch ##ing , you bur ##y them .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
and as a consequence , we ' re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who ' s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don ' t have such simple categ ##ories as we ' ve had before .
now you might think that all this breaking - down of categ ##ories would make somebody like me really happy .
i ' m a political progress ##ive , i defen ##d people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous .
understanding that these categ ##ories are really much more uns ##t ##able than we thought makes me tens ##e .
and it makes me tens ##e from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in order to tell you about that tens ##ion , i have to first admit to you that i ' m a huge fan of the found ##ing father ##s .
i know they were ra ##ci ##sts , i know they were sex ##ist , but they were great .
i mean , they were so bra ##ve and so bol ##d and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that che ##es ##y musical " 17 ##7 ##6 " every few years , and it ' s not because of the music , which is totally forget ##t ##able .
it ' s because of what happened in 17 ##7 ##6 with the found ##ing father ##s .
the found ##ing father ##s were , for my point of view , the original anatom ##ical activ ##ists , and this is why .
what they re ##jected was an anatom ##ical concept and replace ##d it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
so as you all rec ##all , what our found ##ing father ##s were re ##ject ##ing was a concept of mon ##arch ##y , and the mon ##arch ##y was basically based on a very simpl ##istic concept of anatom ##y .
the mon ##arch ##s of the old world didn ' t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birth ##right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth .
the found ##ing father ##s re ##jected that idea , and they replace ##d it with a new anatom ##ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
they level ##ed that playing field and decided the anatom ##y that matter ##ed was the common ##ality of anatom ##y , not the difference in anatom ##y , and that was a really radical thing to do .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an enl ##ighten ##ment system where two things were growing up together .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and it ' s really clear , if you look at the history of the found ##ing father ##s , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural ##istic world .
they were moving away from super ##na ##t ##ural explanation ##s , and they were re ##ject ##ing things like a super ##na ##t ##ural concept of power , where it trans ##mitt ##ed because of a very vag ##ue concept of birth ##right .
they were moving towards a natural ##istic concept .
and if you look , for example , in the dec ##la ##ration of independ ##ence , they talk about nature and nature ' s god .
they don ' t talk about god and god ' s nature .
they ' re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatom ##ical common ##ality .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
they didn ' t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
so what happened years after ##ward ?
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the found ##ing father ##s ' concept of anatom ##ical common ##ality being more important than anatom ##ical difference and said , " the fact that we have a ut ##er ##us and o ##va ##ries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn ' t have the right to vote , the right to full citizens ##hip , the right to own property , etc . , etc . "
and women successful ##ly argue ##d that .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so ##jo ##urn ##er truth talking about , " ain ' t i a woman ? "
we find men on the march ##ing lines of the civil rights movement saying , " i am a man . "
again , people of color app ##e ##aling to a common ##ality of anatom ##y over a difference of anatom ##y , again , successful ##ly .
we see the same thing with the dis ##ability rights movement .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that common ##ality , we have to begin to question why we maint ##ain certain div ##isions .
now mind you , i want to maint ##ain some div ##isions , anatom ##ically , in our culture .
for example , i don ' t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don ' t want to say we give up entirely on anatom ##y .
i don ' t want to say five - year - olds should be allowed to cons ##ent to sex or cons ##ent to mar ##ry .
so there are some anatom ##ical div ##isions that make sense to me and that i think we should ret ##ain .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we ret ##ain them and do they have meaning .
so let ' s go back to those two beings conc ##e ##ived at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both conc ##e ##ived in the middle of 197 ##9 on the exact same day .
let ' s imagine one of them , mary , is born three months prem ##ature ##ly , so she ' s born on jun ##e 1 , 1980 .
henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he ' s born on march 1 , 1980 .
simply by virt ##ue of the fact that mary was born prem ##ature ##ly three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does - - the right to cons ##ent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
henry has to wait for all of that , not because he ' s actually any different in age , biological ##ly , except in terms of when he was born .
we find other kinds of weird ##ness in terms of what their rights are .
henry , by virt ##ue of being assum ##ed to be male - - although i haven ' t told you that he ' s the x ##y one - - by virt ##ue of being assum ##ed to be male is now li ##able to be dra ##fte ##d , which mary does not need to worry about .
mary , mean ##wh ##ile , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , name ##ly , the right to mar ##ry .
henry can mar ##ry in every state a woman , but mary can only mar ##ry today in a few states a woman .
so we have these anatom ##ical categ ##ories that pers ##ist that are in many ways problem ##atic and question ##able .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatom ##y , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that ' s been based on anatom ##y might start falling apart ?
i don ' t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
so where do we go ?
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pra ##g ##mat ##ic att ##itude : " well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . "
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar ##ry a man is to mean that you don ' t have a y chromos ##ome , and what it means to mar ##ry a woman means you do have a y chromos ##ome .
now in practice they don ' t actually test people for their chromos ##omes .
but this is also very bizarre , because of the story i told you at the beginning about and ##rogen inse ##ns ##itiv ##ity synd ##rome .
if we look at one of the found ##ing father ##s of modern democracy , dr . martin lu ##ther king , he offer ##s us something of a solution in his " i have a dream " speech .
he says we should judge people " based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , " moving beyond anatom ##y .
and i want to say , " yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . "
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
i also want to point out that i ' m not sure that is how we should distr ##ib ##ute rights in terms of humans , because , i have to admit , that there are some golden ret ##rie ##vers i know that are probably more deser ##ving of social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say there are probably also some yellow lab ##rad ##ors that i know that are more capable of inform ##ed , intelligent , mat ##ure decisions about sexual relations than some 40 - year - olds that i know .
so how do we operation ##al ##ize the question of content of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me also wonder ##s , what if content of character turns out to be something that ' s scann ##able in the future - - able to be seen with an f ##m ##ri ?
do we really want to go there ?
i ' m not sure where we go .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
we ' ve done a really good job strug ##gling with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
we don ' t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who ' s sexual ##ly attract ##ed to other men is li ##able to be murder ##ed , unless he ' s willing to sub ##mit to a sex change , in which case he ' s allowed to live .
we don ' t have that kind of situation .
i ' m glad to say we don ' t have the kind of situation with - - a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con ##jo ##ined tw ##ins in order to separate them , part ##ly to make a name for himself .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery - - this was a very high - risk surgery - - his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very bad ##ly , and so he had to do this .
my response to him was , " well , have you considered political as ##yl ##um instead of a separ ##ation surgery ? "
the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa ##ke of the state .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i ' ve been talking a lot about the father ##s .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a femin ##ist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insight ##s that can come from different kinds of anatom ##ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
now for years , because i ' ve been interested in inter ##sex , i ' ve also been interested in sex difference research .
and one of the things that i ' ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between male ##s and female ##s in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
and what we know from cross - cultural studies is that female ##s , on average - - not everyone , but on average - - are more incl ##ined to be very att ##ent ##ive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate adv ##ise ##r ##s who knew i was interested in femin ##ism - - i considered myself a femin ##ist , as i still do - - asked a really strange question .
he said , " tell me what ' s femin ##ine about femin ##ism . "
and i thought , " well that ' s the dum ##bes ##t question i ' ve ever heard .
femin ##ism is all about und ##o ##ing stere ##ot ##yp ##es about gender , so there ' s nothing femin ##ine about femin ##ism . "
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something femin ##ine about femin ##ism .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more att ##ent ##ive to deeply complex social relationships and more att ##ent ##ive to taking care of the vulnerable .
so whereas the father ##s were extremely att ##ent ##ive to fig ##uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it ' s possible that if we inj ##ect ##ed more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe that ' s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond anatom ##y , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we ' re thinking about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i ' m jes ##s ##i , and this is my suit ##ca ##se .
but before i show you what i ' ve got inside , i ' m going to make a very public conf ##ession , and that is , i ' m out ##f ##it - obsessed .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph ##ing and blog ##ging a different , color ##ful , crazy out ##f ##it for every single occasion .
but i don ' t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes second ##hand from fle ##a markets and thr ##ift store ##s .
aw ##w , thank you .
second ##hand shop ##ping allows me to reduce the impact my war ##dro ##be has on the environment and on my wall ##et .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shop ##ping like my own personal tre ##as ##ure hun ##t .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i ' ve won .
i want to get back to my suit ##ca ##se and tell you what i pack ##ed for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody with all these out ##f ##its bring with her ?
so i ' m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pair ##s of under ##pan ##ts and that ' s it .
exactly one week ' s worth of und ##ies is all i put in my suit ##ca ##se .
i was bett ##ing that i ' d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to palm spring ##s .
and since you don ' t know me as the woman walking around ted in her under ##we ##ar - - that means i found a few things .
and i ' d really love to show you my week ' s worth of out ##f ##its right now .
does that sound good ?
so as i do this , i ' m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these advent ##ures wearing nothing new .
so let ' s start with sun ##day .
i call this " sh ##in ##y tiger . "
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomen ##al for under $ 50 .
this whole out ##f ##it , including the jack ##et , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wor ##e the entire week .
mond ##ay : color is powerful .
it is almost physi ##ological ##ly impossible to be in a bad mo ##od when you ' re wearing bright red pan ##ts .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
tue ##s ##day : fit ##ting in is way over ##rate ##d .
i ' ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
if you are surround ##ing yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
we ##d ##nes ##day : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i ' m playing dress - up , or that i remind them of their seven - year - old .
i like to smile and say , " thank you . "
th ##urs ##day : confidence is key .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and if you don ' t think you look good in something , you ' re also probably right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this day - in and day - out .
but it wasn ' t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
and i ' m going to break it down for you for just a second .
if you believe you ' re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can ' t pull off .
so there is no exc ##use for any of us here in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
thank you .
fr ##iday : a universal truth - - five words for you : gold se ##qu ##ins go with everything .
and finally , sat ##ur ##day : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it ' s been prove ##n to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i ' m wearing , and we ' ve had great conversations .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suit ##ca ##se .
so before i go home to brook ##lyn , i ' m going to don ##ate everything back .
because the lesson i ' m trying to learn myself this week is that it ' s okay to let go .
i don ' t need to get emotional ##ly attach ##ed to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , color ##ful , sh ##in ##y out ##f ##it just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody .
i ' ve got something to show you .
think about this as a p ##ix ##el , a flying p ##ix ##el .
this is what we call , in our lab , sens ##ible design .
let me tell you a bit about it .
now if you take this picture - - i ' m it ##al ##ian original ##ly , and every boy in it ##aly grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedro ##om - - but the reason i ' m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formul ##a 1 ra ##cing over the past couple of decades .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a formul ##a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you ' d win the race .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this - - something that monitor ##s the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor ##s collect ##ing information from the car , trans ##mitt ##ing this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
and basically , it ' s a system made of two components - - a sens ##ing and an act ##ua ##ting component .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been bl ##anke ##ted with networks , electronic ##s .
they ' re becoming like computers in open air .
and , as computers in open air , they ' re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sense ##d and to be act ##ua ##ted .
if we fix cities , actually it ' s a big deal .
just as an as ##ide , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth ' s cru ##st , but they are 50 percent of the world ' s population .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption - - up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we ' re able to do something with cities , that ' s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this sens ##ing and act ##ua ##ting is enter ##ing our everyday objects .
that ' s from an exhib ##ition that pa ##ola ant ##one ##ll ##i is organ ##izing at mom ##a later this year , during the summer .
it ' s called " talk to me . "
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it ' s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an act ##ua ##to ##r .
and that is radical ##ly changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
in a certain sense , it ' s almost as if the old dream of mich ##el ##ange ##lo . . .
you know , when mich ##el ##ange ##lo sculpt ##ed the mos ##es , at the end it said that he took the ham ##mer , thr ##e ##w it at the mos ##es - - actually you can still see a small chip underneath - - and said , sh ##out ##ed , " per ##che non par ##li ? why don ' t you talk ? "
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and i ' ll show just a few examples - - again , with this idea of sens ##ing our environment and act ##ua ##ting it .
let ' s starting with sens ##ing .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it was four and a half years ago in it ##aly .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deploy ##ed all across the world - - that ' s a cell ##phone network - - and use anonym ##ous and ag ##greg ##ated information from that network , that ' s collected anyway by the oper ##ator , in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a lucky summer - - 2006 .
it ' s when it ##aly won the soc ##cer world cup .
some of you might remember , it was it ##aly and france playing , and then z ##ida ##ne at the end , the head ##bu ##tt .
and anyway , it ##aly won at the end .
now look at what happened that day just by monitor ##ing activity happening on the network .
here you see the city .
you see the col ##oss ##e ##um in the middle , the river tib ##er .
it ' s morning , before the match .
you see the time ##line on the top .
early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
the match begins - - silence .
france score ##s . it ##aly score ##s .
half ##time , people make a quick call and go to the bath ##room .
second half . end of normal time .
first over ##time , second .
z ##ida ##ne , the head ##bu ##tt in a moment .
it ##aly win ##s . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
you saw the big peak .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the win ##ning team and the prime minister at the time .
and then everybody moved down .
you see the image of the place called circ ##o mass ##im ##o , where , since roman times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
well , that ' s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn ' t have done just a few years ago .
another quick example about sens ##ing : it ' s not about people , but about things we use and consum ##e .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a mac computer , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tag ##s to track tra ##sh as it moves through the system .
so we actually started with a number of volunte ##ers who helped us in seat ##t ##le , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throw ##ing away - - different types of things , as you can see here - - things they would throw away anyway .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tra ##sh and then started following it .
here are the results we just ob ##t ##ained .
from seat ##t ##le . . .
after one week .
with this information we realized there ' s a lot of ine ##ffic ##ien ##cies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
this data was not available before .
but there ' s a lot of waste ##d transportation and conv ##ol ##uted things happening .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we ' re throw ##ing away , it doesn ' t disappear , it ' s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we ' re throw ##ing away every day still stay ##s there .
and if we show that to people , then we can also prom ##ote some behavioral change .
so that was the reason for the project .
my colleag ##ue at mit , ass ##af bi ##derm ##an , he could tell you much more about sens ##ing and many other wonderful things we can do with sens ##ing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discuss ##ed at the beginning , and that ' s act ##ua ##ting our environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in z ##ara ##go ##z ##a , sp ##ain .
it started with a question by the may ##or of the city , who came to us saying that sp ##ain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a works ##ho ##p was , imagine this pip ##e , and you ' ve got val ##ves , sol ##en ##oid val ##ves , tap ##s , opening and clos ##ing .
you create like a water cur ##t ##ain with p ##ix ##els made of water .
if those p ##ix ##els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
well , we presented this to may ##or bell ##och .
he liked it very much .
and we got a comm ##ission to design a building at the ent ##ra ##n ##ce of the exp ##o .
we called it digital water pa ##v ##il ##ion .
the whole building is made of water .
there ' s no door ##s or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
the roof also is covered with water .
and if there ' s a bit of wind , if you want to minim ##ize spl ##ash ##ing , you can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , " they dem ##ol ##ished the building . "
no , they didn ' t dem ##ol ##ish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappear ##s .
here ' s the building working .
you see the person puzzle ##d about what was going on inside .
and here was myself trying not to get we ##t , testing the sensor ##s that open the water .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensor ##s stopped working .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
all the kids from z ##ara ##go ##z ##a came to the building , because the way of engag ##ing with the building became something different .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cut ##s and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting we ##t .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
but then reality ' s always un ##pre ##di ##ct ##able .
and that ' s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
here is an image then of the building with the physical p ##ix ##els , the p ##ix ##els made of water , and then project ##ions on them .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i ' ll show you now .
that ' s , imagine those p ##ix ##els could actually start flying .
imagine you could have small hel ##ico ##pte ##r ##s that move in the air , and then each of them with a small p ##ix ##el in changing lights - - almost as a cloud that can move in space .
here is the video .
so imagine one hel ##ico ##pte ##r , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in synchron ##y .
so you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this - - a regular conf ##ig ##ura ##t ##ion in two dimensions .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the p ##ix ##els ' position .
you can play with a different type .
imagine your screen could just appear in different scale ##s or size ##s , different types of resolution .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of p ##ix ##els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
here is the real fly ##fir ##e control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
you can have each p ##ix ##el having an input that comes from people , from people ' s movement , or so and so .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
we ' ve been working with robert ##o bol ##le , one of today ' s top ball ##et dance ##r ##s - - the et ##o ##ile at met ##rop ##ol ##ita ##n in new york and la sc ##ala in mil ##an - - and actually capture ##d his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for fly ##fir ##e .
and here you can see robert ##o dancing .
you see on the left the p ##ix ##els , the different resolution ##s being capture ##d .
it ' s both 3d scann ##ing in real time and motion capture .
so you can recon ##stru ##ct a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
but then , once we have the p ##ix ##els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rot ##ation .
so we want to use this as one of the possible input ##s for fly ##fir ##e .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it ' s something we ' re working on for the london olymp ##ics .
it ' s called the cloud .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involv ##e people in doing something and changing our environment - - almost to imp ##art what we call cloud ra ##ising - - like bar ##n ra ##ising , but with a cloud .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don ##ation for one p ##ix ##el .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
this has been digit ##izing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the internet .
now today , for the first time - - and the obama campaign showed us this - - we can go from the digital world , from the self - organ ##izing power of networks , to the physical one .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
that means something built in a city .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to tack ##le today ' s press ##ing challenges - - think about climate change or co2 emissions - - how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so the idea that we can actually involv ##e people in doing this thing together , collective ##ly .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of p ##ix ##els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of p ##ix ##els .
it ' s a physical structure in london , but covered with p ##ix ##els .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olymp ##ics in 201 ##2 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top [ of ] , like london ' s new mountain ##to ##p .
you can enter inside it .
and a kind of new digital be ##ac ##on for the night - - but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work i ' m trying to art ##ic ##ulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter ##conne ##cted .
i first went to antar ##ctic ##a almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ice ##berg ##s .
i was in aw ##e .
my heart beat fast , my head was di ##zz ##y , trying to comp ##rehen ##d what it was that stood in front of me .
the ice ##berg ##s around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one snow ##fl ##ake on top of another snow ##fl ##ake , year after year .
ice ##berg ##s are born when they cal ##ve off of gl ##ac ##iers or break off of ice shel ##ves .
each ice ##berg has its own individual personal ##ity .
they have a dist ##inct way of interact ##ing with their environment and their experiences .
some ref ##use to give up and hold on to the bitte ##r end , while others can ' t take it anymore and cru ##m ##ble in a fit of dramatic passion .
it ' s easy to think , when you look at an ice ##berg , that they ' re isol ##ated , that they ' re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
but the reality is far from it .
as an ice ##berg melt ##s , i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
as the ice ##berg melt ##s , it is rele ##asing miner ##al - rich fresh water that no ##ur ##ish ##es many forms of life .
i approach photograph ##ing these ice ##berg ##s as if i ' m making portrait ##s of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continu ##ation of their path through the cycle of life .
some of the ice in the ice ##berg ##s that i photograph is very young - - a couple thousand years old .
and some of the ice is over 100 , 000 years old .
the last pictures i ' d like to show you are of an ice ##berg that i photograph ##ed in q ##e ##q ##et ##ars ##ua ##q , green ##land .
it ' s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an ice ##berg roll ##ing .
so here it is .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
that ' s about a 15 - foot boat .
and i ' d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ice ##berg and where it is at the water ##line .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an average - size green ##land ##ic ice ##berg .
it ' s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , the ice ##berg shows you a different side of its personal ##ity .
thank you .
i have had the dist ##inct ble ##ss ##ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
but the cool ##est i ever worked on was around this guy .
this guy ' s name is tem ##pt .
tem ##pt was one of the fore ##most graf ##f ##iti artists in the 80 ##s .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , " dad , my legs are tin ##gling . "
and that was the on ##set of als .
so tem ##pt is now completely paraly ##zed .
he only has use of his eyes .
i was exp ##osed to him .
i have a company that does design and animation , so obviously graf ##f ##iti is definitely an intr ##icate part of what we adm ##ire and respect in the art world .
and so we decided that we were going to spons ##or tony , tem ##pt , and his cause .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , " we ' re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? "
and his brother said , " i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , " wait a second , isn ' t that - - i ' ve seen stephen haw ##king - - don ' t all paraly ##zed people have the ability to communicate vi ##a these devices ? "
and he said , " no , unless you ' re in the upper ech ##el ##on and you ' ve got really amazing ins ##urance , you can ' t actually do that .
these devices aren ' t accessible to people . "
and i said , " well , how do you actually communicate ? "
has everyone seen the movie " the div ##ing bell and the but ##ter ##fl ##y ? "
that ' s how they communicate - - so run their finger along .
i said , " that ' s arch ##ai ##c . how can that be ? "
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre ##aking idea how i was going to cash .
i commit ##ted to his brother and his father right then and there - - i ' m like , " all right , here ' s the deal : tony ' s going to speak , we ' re going to get him a machine , and we ' re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
because it ' s a tra ##vest ##y that someone who still has all of that in him isn ' t able to communicate it . "
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
i met these guys called gr ##l , graf ##f ##iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser point ##er , draw on it , and it just reg ##isters the negative space .
so they go around and do art install ##ations like this .
all the things that go up there , they said there ' s a life cycle .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with c ##uss words , then it was bush sla ##nder ##s and then people actually got to art .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentation ##s .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , " well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don ' t we figure out a way for tem ##pt to control a laser and he could do graf again ? well that would be awesome . "
so that started the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we ' d accompl ##ished a couple things .
one , we batter ##ed down the door ##s of the ins ##urance companies , and we actually got tem ##pt a machine that let him communicate - - a stephen haw ##king machine .
which was awesome .
and he ' s seriously one of the fun ##n ##iest - - i call him y ##od ##a , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you ' re like , " i ' m not worth ##y . this guy ' s so amazing . "
the other thing we did is we flew seven programme ##r ##s from all over the world - - literally every corner of the world - - into our house .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these hack ##ers and programme ##r ##s and cons ##p ##ir ##acy theor ##ists and an ##arch ##ists took over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be remove ##d and graf on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we programme ##d , we went to the ven ##ice board ##wa ##l ##k , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
this is called the eye ##w ##ri ##ter , and you can see the descri ##ption .
this is a cheap pair of sun ##gl ##asse ##s that we bought at the ven ##ice beach board ##wa ##l ##k , some cop ##per wire and some stuff from home dep ##ot and radio sh ##ack .
we took a p ##s ##3 camera , hack ##ed it open , mount ##ed it to an led light , and now there ' s a device that is free - - you build this yourself , we publ ##ish the code for free , you download the software for free .
and now we ' ve created a device that has absolutely no limit ##ations .
there ' s no ins ##urance company that can say " no . "
there ' s no hospital that can say " no . "
anybody who ' s paraly ##zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tem ##pt ' s room .
i love this picture , because this is someone else ' s room and that ' s his room .
so there ' s all this hus ##t ##le and bus ##t ##le going on for the big un ##ve ##iling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programm ##ing , car ##b - fest and all - night session ##s , tony dre ##w again for the first time in seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he ' s looking over his life support system .
we kick ##ed his bed so that he could see out .
and we set up a project ##or on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
and he dre ##w again for the first time , in front of his family and friends - - and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : " that was the first time i ' ve draw ##n anything for seven years .
i feel like i had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe . "
isn ' t that awesome ?
so that ' s kind of our battle cry .
that ' s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
and we ' ve got such a long way to go with this .
this is an amazing device , but it ' s the equivalent of an etc ##h a sket ##ch .
and someone who has that kind of artist ##ic potential deser ##ves so much more .
so we ' re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
since that time , we ' ve had all kinds of ack ##no ##w ##led ##gment .
we ' ve won a bunch of aw ##ards .
remember , it ' s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
it ' s all coming out of our own pocket ##s .
so the aw ##ards were like , " oh , this is fantastic . "
arms ##tr ##ong twitter ##ed about us , and then in dec ##ember , time magazine honor ##ed us as one of the top 50 invention ##s of 2010 , which was really cool .
the cool ##est thing about this - - and this is what ' s comple ##ting the whole circle - - is that in april of this year , at the gef ##fen mo ##ca in down ##to ##wn los angeles , there ' s going to be an exhib ##ition called " art of the streets . "
and " art of the streets " is going to have pretty much the bad - ass ##es of the street art scene - - bank ##sy , she ##par ##d fair ##e ##y , ka ##ws - - all of these guys will be there .
tem ##pt ' s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that ' s not possible , make it possible .
everything in this room wasn ' t possible - - this stage , this computer , this mic , the eye ##w ##ri ##ter - - wasn ' t possible at one point .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
i ' m not a programme ##r , never done anything with o ##cul ##ar recogn ##ition technology , but i just recognize ##d something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you guys .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i ' m probably america ' s most wide ##ly read children ' s author , in fact .
and i always tell people that i don ' t want to show up looking like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea ##thers , and no one has ever chose farmer .
i ' m here today to talk to you about circle ##s and ep ##ip ##han ##ies .
and you know , an ep ##ip ##han ##y is usually something you find that you dropped some ##place .
you ' ve just got to go around the block to see it as an ep ##ip ##han ##y .
that ' s a painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did that - - richard bol ##ling ##br ##oke .
it ' s the kind of complicated circle that i ' m going to tell you about .
my circle began back in the ' 60s in high school in sto ##w , oh ##io where i was the class que ##er .
i was the guy beat ##en up blood ##y every week in the boys ' room , until one teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by let ##ting me go to the bath ##room in the teachers ' lou ##ng ##e .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
i had a th ##umb , i had 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california - - met a love ##r - - and back in the ' 80 ##s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mr ##s . post ##en , who said , " i need to see you .
i ' m disapp ##o ##inted that we never got to know each other as adults .
could you please come to oh ##io , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
and i should mention that i have pan ##c ##reat ##ic cancer , and i ' d like you to please be quick about this . "
well , the next day we were in cle ##vel ##and .
we took a look at her , we laugh ##ed , we cr ##ied , and we knew that she needed to be in a hosp ##ice .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
it ' s something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of as ##hes and was place ##d in my hands .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle - - and that ep ##ip ##han ##y i talked about presented itself .
the ep ##ip ##han ##y is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved her ##s .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
it needs truth and beauty , and i ' m so happy it ' s been mentioned so much here today .
it also needs - - it needs dign ##ity , love and pleasure , and it ' s our job to hand those things out .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3 , 000 f ##t .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine an engine going cla ##ck , cla ##ck , cla ##ck , cla ##ck , cla ##ck , cla ##ck , cla ##ck .
it sounds scary .
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in 1 ##d .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight att ##end ##ants .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , " no problem . we probably hit some birds . "
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren ' t that far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hu ##ds ##on river .
that ' s usually not the route .
he turns off the engine ##s .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
and then he says three words - - the most une ##mo ##t ##ional three words i ' ve ever heard .
he says , " bra ##ce for impact . "
i didn ' t have to talk to the flight att ##end ##ant anymore .
i could see in her eyes , it was terror . life was over .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
i learned that it all changes in an inst ##ant .
we have this buck ##et list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn ' t , all the fen ##ces i wanted to men ##d , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , " i collect bad wine ##s . "
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i ' m opening it .
i no longer want to post ##po ##ne anything in life .
and that ur ##gency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day - - and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot - - i thought about , wow , i really feel one real reg ##ret .
i ' ve lived a good life .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i ' ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
but in my humanity , i also allow my ego to get in .
and i reg ##ret ##ted the time i waste ##d on things that did not matter with people that matter .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and after , as i refle ##cted on that , i decided to elimin ##ate negative energy from my life .
it ' s not perfect , but it ' s a lot better .
i ' ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
it feels great .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned - - and this is as your mental clock starts going , " 15 , 14 , 13 . "
you can see the water coming .
i ' m saying , " please blow up . "
i don ' t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you ' ve seen in those document ##aries .
and as we ' re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
it ' s almost like we ' ve been prepar ##ing for it our whole lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn ' t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sad ##ness really frame ##d in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter - - first - grade ##r , not much artist ##ic talent . . .
. . . yet .
and i ' m ba ##w ##ling , i ' m cry ##ing , like a little kid .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
i realized at that point , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
i was given the gift of a mir ##acle , of not dying that day .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane - - and please don ' t - - but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you get done that you ' re waiting to get done because you think you ' ll be here forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stu ##x ##net computer wor ##m is actually quite simple .
we don ' t want iran to get the bomb .
their major ass ##et for developing nuclear weapons is the nat ##anz ur ##ani ##um en ##ric ##hmen ##t fac ##ility .
the gray boxes that you see , these are real - time control systems .
now if we manage to comp ##rom ##ise these systems that control drive speed ##s and val ##ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent ##ri ##f ##uge .
the gray boxes don ' t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a note ##book that is used by a maint ##en ##ance engineer to conf ##ig ##ure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the plot behind stu ##x ##net .
so we start with a windows drop ##per .
the pay ##load goes onto the gray box , damage ##s the cent ##ri ##f ##uge , and the iran ##ian nuclear program is del ##ay ##ed - - mission accompl ##ished .
that ' s easy , hu ##h ?
i want to tell you how we found that out .
when we started our research on stu ##x ##net six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing that was known is it ' s very , very complex on the windows part , the drop ##per part , used multiple zero - day vulner ##abilities .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real - time control systems .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stu ##x ##net and check ##ed this thing out .
and then some very funny things happened .
stu ##x ##net behav ##ed like a lab rat that didn ' t like our che ##ese - - sn ##iffe ##d , but didn ' t want to eat .
didn ' t make sense to me .
and after we experimente ##d with different fl ##avor ##s of che ##ese , i realized , well , this is a direct ##ed attack .
it ' s completely direct ##ed .
the drop ##per is pro ##w ##ling active ##ly on the gray box if a specific conf ##ig ##ura ##t ##ion is found , and even if the actual program code that it ' s trying to infe ##ct is actually running on that target .
and if not , stu ##x ##net does nothing .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , " well , we don ' t know what the target is .
it could be , let ' s say for example , a u . s . power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we better find out what the target is soon . "
so we extra ##cted and dec ##om ##p ##iled the attack code , and we discovered that it ' s structure ##d in two digital bombs - - a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also saw that they are very professional ##ly engineer ##ed by people who obviously had all inside ##r information .
they knew all the bits and bit ##es that they had to attack .
they probably even know the sh ##oe size of the oper ##ator .
so they know everything .
and if you have heard that the drop ##per of stu ##x ##net is complex and high - tech , let me tell you this : the pay ##load is rocket science .
it ' s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
we are talking about - - around about 15 , 000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like old - style assem ##bly language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for time ##r ##s and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world - - to potential real world target ##s .
so we do need target theorie ##s that we can prove or disp ##ro ##ve .
in order to get target theorie ##s , we remember that it ' s definitely hard ##co ##re sa ##bot ##age , it must be a high - value target and it is most likely loc ##ated in iran , because that ' s where most of the infe ##ctions had been report ##ed .
now you don ' t find several thousand target ##s in that area .
it basically bo ##ils down to the bush ##e ##hr nuclear power plant and to the nat ##anz fuel en ##ric ##hmen ##t plant .
so i told my assist ##ant , " get me a list of all cent ##ri ##f ##uge and power plant experts from our cl ##ient base . "
and i phone ##d them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expert ##ise with what we found in code and data .
and that worked pretty well .
so we were able to assoc ##iate the small digital war ##head with the rot ##or control .
the rot ##or is that moving part within the cent ##ri ##f ##uge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipul ##ate the speed of this rot ##or , you are actually able to crack the rot ##or and eventually even have the cent ##ri ##f ##uge explod ##e .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre ##ep ##y - - obviously in an effort to drive maint ##en ##ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the big digital war ##head - - we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 16 ##4 really stands out in that code ; you can ' t over ##lo ##ok it .
i started to research scientific literature on how these cent ##ri ##f ##uge ##s are actually built in nat ##anz and found they are structure ##d in what is called a cas ##ca ##de , and each cas ##ca ##de hold ##s 16 ##4 cent ##ri ##f ##uge ##s .
so that made sense , that was a match .
and it even got better .
these cent ##ri ##f ##uge ##s in iran are sub ##di ##v ##ided into 15 , what is called , stage ##s .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a real good match .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
now don ' t get me wrong here , it didn ' t go like this .
these results have been ob ##t ##ained over several weeks of really hard labor .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war ##head ##s were actually a ##imin ##g at one and the same target , but from different ang ##les .
the small war ##head is taking one cas ##ca ##de , and spin ##ning up the rot ##ors and slow ##ing them down , and the big war ##head is talking to six cas ##ca ##des and manipul ##ating val ##ves .
so in all , we are very conf ##ident that we have actually determine ##d what the target is .
it is nat ##anz , and it is only nat ##anz .
so we don ' t have to worry that other target ##s might be hit by stu ##x ##net .
here ' s some very cool stuff that we saw - - really knock ##ed my soc ##ks off .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the cent ##ri ##f ##uge ##s .
now what this thing does is it inter ##cept ##s the input values from sensor ##s - - so for example , from pressure sensor ##s and vibr ##ation sensor ##s - - and it provide ##s legit ##imate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually pre ##re ##co ##r ##ded by stu ##x ##net .
so it ' s just like from the hollywood movies where during the he ##ist , the observ ##ation camera is fed with pre ##re ##co ##r ##ded video .
that ' s cool , hu ##h ?
the idea here is obviously not only to fo ##ol the oper ##ators in the control room .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggress ##ive .
the idea is to circum ##vent a digital safety system .
we need digital safety systems where a human oper ##ator could not act quick enough .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big ste ##am tur ##bi ##ne gets too over speed , you must open rel ##ief val ##ves within a mill ##ise ##con ##d .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper ##ator .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and when they are comp ##rom ##ised , then real bad things can happen .
your plant can blow up .
and neither your oper ##ators nor your safety system will notice it .
that ' s scary .
but it gets worse .
and this is very important , what i ' m going to say .
think about this : this attack is gener ##ic .
it doesn ' t have anything to do , in specific ##s , with cent ##ri ##f ##uge ##s , with ur ##ani ##um en ##ric ##hmen ##t .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automob ##ile factory .
it is gener ##ic .
and you don ' t have - - as an attack ##er - - you don ' t have to deliver this pay ##load by a us ##b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu ##x ##net .
you could also use conventional wor ##m technology for spreading .
just spread it as wide as possible .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weap ##on of mass destruction .
that ' s the consequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of target ##s for such attacks are not in the middle east .
they ' re in the united states and europe and in japan .
so all of the green areas , these are your target - rich environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepar ##e right now .
thanks .
i ' ve got a question .
ra ##l ##ph , it ' s been quite wide ##ly report ##ed that people assum ##e that mos ##sa ##d is the main ent ##ity behind this .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is that the mos ##sa ##d is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber super ##po ##wer .
there is only one , and that ' s the united states - - fort ##unately , fort ##unately .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
thank you for scar ##ing the living day ##light ##s out of us . thank you , ra ##l ##ph .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
i went to prison - - difficult .
i worked in a coal mine - - dangerous .
i filme ##d in war zone ##s - - difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this - - fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , i ' ve been immer ##s ##ing myself into seem ##ingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to exam ##ine soc ##iet ##al issues in a way that make them engag ##ing , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertain ##ing and accessible to an audience .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of brand ##ing and spons ##ors ##hip , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on eb ##ay .
i sent out some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam ##ing rights to my 2011 ted talk .
that ' s right , some lucky individual , corpor ##ation , for - profit or non - profit , was going to get the once - in - a - lifetime opportunity - - because i ' m sure chris anders ##on will never let it happen again - - to buy the nam ##ing rights to the talk you ' re watching right now , that at the time didn ' t have a title , didn ' t really have a lot of content and didn ' t really give much hin ##t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so what you were getting was this : your name here present ##s : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
but that being said , it ' s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
it ' s a lot .
that ' s just a working title , by the way .
so even with that ca ##ve ##at , i knew that someone would buy the nam ##ing rights .
now if you ' d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn ' t have been able to tell you that with any certain ##ty .
but in the new project that i ' m working on , my new film , we exam ##ine the world of marketing , advertising .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepar ##e me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
what i want to do is make a film all about product place ##ment , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is fund ##ed by product place ##ment , marketing and advertising .
so the movie will be called " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so what happens in " the greatest movie ever sold , " is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is brand ##ed from beginning to end - - from the above - the - title spons ##or that you ' ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
now this brand , the qual ##com ##m stad ##ium , the stap ##les center . . .
these people will be married to the film in per ##pet ##uit ##y - - forever .
and so the film explore ##s this whole idea - - it ' s what ? in per ##pet ##uit ##y , forever ?
i ' m a redu ##nd ##ant person .
that was more for emp ##ha ##s ##is .
it was , " in per ##pet ##uit ##y . forever . "
but not only are we going to have the brand x title spons ##or , but we ' re going to make sure we sell out every categ ##ory we can in the film .
so maybe we sell a sh ##oe and it becomes the greatest sh ##oe you ever wor ##e . . .
the greatest car you ever dro ##ve from " the greatest movie ever sold , " the greatest drink you ' ve ever had , court ##es ##y of " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so the idea is , beyond just showing that brand ##s are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you ' re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so that ' s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
and i would love for ce ##g to help make it happen .
you know it ' s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
i don ' t know how rece ##pt ##ive people are going to be to it , though .
do you have a perspective - - i don ' t want to use " ang ##le " because that has a negative con ##not ##ation - - but do you know how this is going to play out ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
1 . 5 million .
i think that you ' re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it ' s certainly worth purs ##uing a couple big , really obvious brand ##s .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bl ##ither ##ing id ##iot ##s .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the response ##s mostly will be " no . "
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
j ##k : both .
. . . meaning not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help you .
okay .
awesome .
we ' ve gott ##a figure out which brand ##s .
yeah .
when you look at the people you deal with . .
we ' ve got some places we can go .
turn the camera off .
i thought " turn the camera off " meant , " let ' s have an off - the - record conversation . "
turns out it really means , " we want nothing to do with your movie . "
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappear ##ed .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
i was amaz ##ed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
and i was blow ##n away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
especially in today ' s world , this inter ##se ##ction of new media and old media and the fra ##cture ##d media landscape , isn ' t the idea to get that new bu ##zz - worth ##y deliver ##y vehicle that ' s going to get that message to the masse ##s ?
no , that ' s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fat ##al fl ##aw , and that fl ##aw was this .
actually no , that was not the fl ##aw what ##so ##ever .
that wouldn ' t have been a problem at all .
this would have been fine .
but what this image represents was the problem .
see , when you do a google image search for transparency , this is - - - this is one of the first images that comes up .
so i like the way you roll , ser ##ge ##y br ##in . no .
this is was the problem : transparency - - free from pret ##ens ##e or dec ##eit ; easily detect ##ed or seen through ; read ##ily understood ; character ##ized by vis ##ibility or access ##ibility of information , especially concern ##ing business practice ##s - - that last line being probably the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce ##o ' s say it .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , transparency is scary - - like that odd , still - scre ##aming bear .
it ' s un ##pre ##di ##ct ##able - - like this odd country road .
and it ' s also very risk ##y .
what else is risk ##y ?
eating an entire bow ##l of cool wh ##ip .
that ' s very risk ##y .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , " no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . "
see , when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie - - and there he is giving me the look he often gave me - - he would say , " son , there ' s three sides to every story .
there ' s your story , there ' s my story and there ' s the real story . "
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me - - and that ' s only because i knew john bond and richard kir ##sh ##en ##bau ##m for years - - i realized that i would have to go on my own , i ' d have to cut out the middle ##man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
so what you suddenly started to realize - - or what i started to realize - - is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make great big , giant hollywood films , and i have friends who make little independent films like i make .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , " well , how are we supposed to compet ##e with these big , giant hollywood movies ? "
and the movie is called " the greatest movie ever sold . "
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
any time i ' m ready to go , any time i open up my medicine ca ##bi ##net , you will see ban de ##od ##ora ##nt .
while any ##time i do an interview with someone , i can say , " are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you cal ##m down .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . "
so we ' ll offer one of these fab ##ulous scen ##ts .
whether it ' s a " flor ##al fusion " or a " parad ##ise wind ##s , " they ' ll have their chance .
we will have them ge ##ared for both male or female - - solid , roll - on or stick , whatever it may be .
that ' s the two - cent tour .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five - cent tour .
we are a smaller brand .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we ' re very much a challenge ##r brand .
so we don ' t have the budget ##s that other brand ##s have .
so doing things like this - - you know , remind people about ban - - is kind of why were interested in it .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
ban is bl ##ank .
that ' s a great question .
super ##ior technology .
technology ' s not the way you want to describe something somebody ' s putting in their arm ##p ##it .
we talk about bol ##d , fresh .
i think " fresh " is a great word that really spin ##s this categ ##ory into the positive , versus " fight ##s od ##or and we ##t ##ness . "
it keeps you fresh .
how do we keep you fresh ##er longer - - better fresh ##ness , more fresh ##ness , three times fresh ##er .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that ' s a multi - million dollar corpor ##ation .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular joe ##s .
they need to tell me about my brand .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
um , my brand ?
i don ' t know .
i like really nice clothes .
80 ' s rev ##ival meet ##s sk ##ater - pun ##k , unless it ' s lau ##nd ##ry day .
all right , what is brand ger ##ry ?
unique .
i guess what kind of gen ##re , style i am would be like dark glam ##or .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray ##s and stuff like that .
but usually i have an access ##ory , like sun ##gl ##asse ##s , or i like cry ##sta ##l and things like that too .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classic conver ##t ##ible mer ##ced ##es ben ##z .
the brand that i am is , i would call it cas ##ual fly .
part hipp ##ie , part y ##og ##i , part brook ##lyn girl - - i don ' t know .
i ' m the pet guy .
i sell pet toy ##s all over the country , all over the world .
so i guess that ' s my brand .
in my war ##ped little industry , that ' s my brand .
my brand is fed ##e ##x because i deliver the goods .
failed writer - al ##co ##hol ##ic brand .
is that something ?
i ' m a law ##yer brand .
i ' m tom .
well we can ' t all be brand tom , but i do often find myself at the inter ##se ##ction of dark glam ##or and cas ##ual fly .
and what i realized is i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your " brand personal ##ity . "
and so i found a company called ol ##son z ##alt ##man in pitt ##s ##burg .
they ' ve helped companies like nest ##le , fe ##bre ##ze , hall ##mark discover that brand personal ##ity .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so tell me a little bit how it relate ##s to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
tell me about this world .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in - - like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
all those things stem ##med and started from one place , and for me they stem ##med and started with my family in west virginia .
what ' s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one : this was the best day ever .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it ' s like , who do i want to be ?
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the " why " phase - - what does that do for us ?
what is the mache ##te ? what pu ##pa stage are you in now ?
why is it important to re ##bo ##ot ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
. . . a little more about you that is not who you are .
what are some other met ##am ##or ##ph ##oses that you ' ve had ?
. . . doesn ' t have to be fear . what kind of rolle ##r coast ##er are you on ?
e ##e ##e ##e ##e ##e ! no , thank you .
thanks for you pat ##ience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don ' t know what ' s going to come of this .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two dist ##inct , but comple ##ment ##ary sides to your brand personal ##ity - - the mor ##gan sp ##ur ##lock brand is a mind ##ful / play brand .
those are ju ##xt ##ap ##osed very nice ##ly together .
and i think there ' s almost a paradox with those .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their strength ##s or the other instead of focus ##ing on both .
most companies tend to - - and it ' s human nature - - to avoid things that they ' re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positive ##s for you , and it ' s a ne ##at thing to see .
what other brand ##s are like that ?
the first on here is the classic , apple .
and you can see here too , target , w ##i ##i , mini from the mini cooper ##s , and jet ##bl ##ue .
now there ' s play ##ful brand ##s and mind ##ful brand ##s , those things that have come and gone , but a play ##ful , mind ##ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a play ##ful , mind ##ful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personal ##ity , what would you be ?
are you an up att ##ribute ? are you something that gets the blood flow ##ing ?
or are you more of a down att ##ribute ?
are you something that ' s a little more cal ##m , reser ##ved , conserv ##ative ?
up att ##ribute ##s are things like being play ##ful , being fresh like the fresh princ ##e , contem ##por ##ary , advent ##ur ##ous , ed ##g ##y or darin ##g like err ##ol fly ##n ##n , n ##im ##ble or ag ##ile , prof ##ane , domin ##e ##ering , magic ##al or my ##stic ##al like gand ##al ##f .
or are you more of a down att ##ribute ?
are you mind ##ful , sophisticated like 0 ##0 ##7 ?
are you establ ##ished , traditional , nur ##t ##uring , protect ##ive , empath ##etic like the op ##rah ?
are you rel ##iable , stab ##le , familiar , safe , sec ##ure , sac ##red , contem ##pl ##ative or wise like the da ##la ##i lam ##a or y ##od ##a ?
over the course of this film , we had 500 - plus companies who were up and down companies saying , " no , " they didn ' t want any part of this project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main ##ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to rel ##in ##qu ##ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mind ##ful and as play ##ful as myself and who ultimately empower ##ed us to tell stories that normally we wouldn ' t be able to tell - - stories that an advert ##ise ##r would normally never get behind .
they enable ##d us to tell the story about neur ##om ##ark ##et ##ing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they ' re using mr ##i ' s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercial ##s as well as movie marketing .
we went to san paul ##o where they have ban ##ne ##d out ##do ##or advertising .
in the entire city for the past five years , there ' s no bill ##board ##s , there ' s no poster ##s , there ' s no flie ##r ##s , nothing .
and we went to school distr ##ict ##s where now companies are making their way into cash - stra ##pped schools all across america .
what ' s incredible for me is the projects that i ' ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i ' ve had the most success in , are ones where i ' ve interact ##ed with things directly .
and that ' s what these brand ##s did .
they cut out the middle ##man , they cut out their age ##n ##cies and said , " maybe these age ##n ##cies don ' t have my best interest in mind .
i ' m going to deal directly with the artist .
i ' m going to work with him to create something different , something that ' s going to get people thinking , that ' s going to challenge the way we look at the world . "
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
well , since the film prem ##iere ##d at the sun ##da ##n ##ce film fest ##ival , let ' s take a look .
according to bur ##rel ##les , the movie prem ##iere ##d in janu ##ary , and since then - - and this isn ' t even the whole thing - - we ' ve had 90 ##0 million media impress ##ions for this film .
that ' s literally cover ##ing just like a two and a half - week period .
that ' s only online - - no print , no tv .
the film hasn ' t even been distributed yet .
it ' s not even online . it ' s not even stream ##ing .
it ' s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of moment ##um .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to adv ##ised their cl ##ients not to take part .
what i always believe is that if you take chance ##s , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you ' re push ##ing them more towards failure .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk av ##ers ##e , then you ' re prepar ##ing your whole company to be reward challenge ##d .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scar ##e them .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embrace fear .
we ' ve got to put that bear in a ca ##ge .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
one big spo ##on ##ful at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
today , more than ever , a little honest ##y is going to go a long way .
and that being said , through honest ##y and transparency , my entire talk , " embrace transparency , " has been brought to you by my good friends at em ##c , who for $ 7 , 100 bought the nam ##ing rights on eb ##ay .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
em ##c present ##s : " embrace transparency . "
thank you very much , guys .
so , mor ##gan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7 , 100 ?
that is a fantastic question .
i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization , the sa ##pl ##ing foundation - - a check for $ 7 , 100 to be applied toward my att ##end ##ance for next year ' s ted .
my name is am ##it .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i p ##itch ##ed this idea of doing something with museum ##s and art to my bos ##s who ' s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , negot ##iation ##s and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museum ##s from nine countries .
but i ' m going to focus on the dem ##o .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it ' s access .
and i grew up in india .
i had a great education - - i ' m not compl ##aining - - but i didn ' t have access to a lot of these museum ##s and these art ##work ##s .
and so when i started traveling and going to these museum ##s , i started learning a lot .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
i ' m going to probably get into the dem ##o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we ' ve had since launch .
so , simple : you come to google ##art ##pro ##ject . com .
you look around at all these museum ##s here .
you ' ve got the u ##ffiz ##i , you ' ve got the mom ##a , the her ##mit ##age , the r ##i ##j ##ks , the van go ##gh .
i ' m going to actually get to one of my favorite ##s , the met ##rop ##ol ##ita ##n museum of art in new york .
two ways of going in - - very simple .
click and , bang , you ' re in this museum .
it doesn ' t matter where you are - - bomb ##ay , mexico , it doesn ' t really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navig ##ate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you ' re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor ##ri ##do ##r .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
thanks . i haven ' t come to the best part .
so now i ' m in front of one of my favorite paintings , " the harvest ##ers " by pie ##ter bru ##e ##gel at the met .
i see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the met ##a - data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this - - but i ' m going to click this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we capture ##d in what we call gig ##ap ##ix ##el technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion p ##ix ##els .
and i get a lot of people asking me : " what do you get for 10 billion p ##ix ##els ? "
so i ' m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion p ##ix ##els .
you can zoom around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i love this guy ; his expression is price ##less .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
and i was like , " hold on . that sounds interesting . "
went in , and i started not ##icing that these kids were actually beat ##ing something .
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contact ##s at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ ##all , which involv ##es beat ##ing a go ##ose with a stick on shr ##ove tue ##s ##day .
and appar ##ently it was quite popular .
i don ' t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the crack ##s .
now just to give you some perspective , i ' m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come - - so in a second .
so now let ' s just quickly jump into the mom ##a , again in new york .
so another one of my favorite ##s , " the star ##ry night . "
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
but what if you want to see bru ##sh stro ##kes ?
and what if you want to see how van go ##gh actually created this master ##pie ##ce ?
you zoom in . you really go in .
i ' m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i ' m really going to get to the crack ##s .
this is " the star ##ry night , " i think , never seen like this before .
i ' m going to show you my other favorite feature .
there ' s a lot of other stuff here , but i don ' t have time .
this is the real cool part . it ' s called collection ##s .
any one of you , anybody - - doesn ' t matter if you ' re rich , if you ' re poor , if you have a fan ##cy house - - doesn ' t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online - - create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in - - and i ' ve created this , called the power of zoom - - you can just zoom around .
this is " the amb ##ass ##ado ##r ##s , " based in the national gall ##ery .
you can ann ##ota ##te the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you ' re feeling when you go through these master ##pie ##ces .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it doesn ' t , in my opinion , even come from the museum ##s .
i probably shouldn ' t say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that ' s been my hum ##bling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art ##work and represent it properly online .
and the biggest question i get asked now ##ada ##ys is , " did you do this to repl ##icate the experience of going to a museum ? "
and the answer is no .
it ' s to supp ##lement the experience .
and that ' s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a represent ##ation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
there ' s the left half , which is the logic ##al side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap ##t ##itude of each hem ##is ##pher ##e , then we can plot our brain .
and for example , this would be somebody who ' s completely logic ##al .
this would be someone who ' s entirely intuitive .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have opt ##ed for one of these extreme ##s , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this - - with a high ap ##t ##itude in both hem ##is ##pher ##es at the same time .
it ' s not like they ' re mut ##ually exc ##lu ##s ##ive or anything .
you can be logic ##al and intuitive .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experiment ##al quantum physicist ##s , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
and really you do the same thing .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren ' t born with this notion , you developed it .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
he was just a tod ##dle ##r and he wasn ' t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that ' s that large things don ' t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and so this is a great concept ##ual model to have of the world , unless you ' re a particle physicist .
it ' d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don ' t play with car stop ##s , they play with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things - - like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these observ ##ations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechan ##ics .
and so that ' s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechan ##ics to describe little , tiny particles .
but you didn ' t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
this didn ' t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it ' s just because i don ' t play with particles very often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i ' ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ' s ever seen a particle .
but it didn ' t sit well with my logic ##al side either .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechan ##ics , then shouldn ' t everything just follow quantum mechan ##ics ?
i don ' t see any reason why it shouldn ' t .
and so i ' d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follow ##s quantum mechan ##ics .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
so i made one .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum super ##po ##s ##ition .
so what we ' re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
and that ' s this piece of metal i ' m going to be talking about in a minute .
this is a photograph of the object .
and here i ' ll zoom in a little bit . we ' re looking right there in the center .
and then here ' s a really , really big close - up of the little piece of metal .
so what we ' re looking at is a little ch ##unk of metal , and it ' s shaped like a div ##ing board , and it ' s stick ##ing out over a led ##ge .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wa ##fer , and then i just cra ##n ##ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine - - to make this swimming pool - shaped hole underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum super ##po ##s ##ition , but it needs a little help to do it .
here , let me give you an analog ##y .
you know how uncom ##fort ##able it is to be in a crowd ##ed elev ##ator ?
i mean , when i ' m in an elev ##ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don ' t want to both ##er them , or , frankly , scar ##e them .
so quantum mechan ##ics says that in ##ani ##mat ##e objects feel the same way .
the fellow passen ##gers for in ##ani ##mat ##e objects are not just people , but it ' s also the light sh ##ining on it and the wind blow ##ing past it and the heat of the room .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behav ##e quantum mechanical ##ly , we ' re going to have to kick out all the other passen ##gers .
and so that ' s what we did .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vac ##uum and suc ##ked out all the air , and then we cool ##ed it down now , all alone in the elev ##ator , the little ch ##unk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
and so we measured its motion .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibr ##ating , and the way it was vibr ##ating was breathing something like this - - like expand ##ing and contra ##cting bell ##ows .
and by giving it a gent ##le nu ##d ##ge , we were able to make it both vibr ##ate and not vibr ##ate at the same time - - something that ' s only allowed with quantum mechan ##ics .
so what i ' m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibr ##ating and not vibr ##ating at the same time ?
so let ' s think about the atoms .
so in one case : all the trillion ##s of atoms that make up that ch ##unk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
now it ' s only at precise times when they al ##ign .
the rest of the time they ' re del ##oc ##al ##ized .
that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch ##unk of metal is in two different places .
i think this is really cool .
really .
it was worth loc ##king myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that ch ##unk of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch ##unk of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that ch ##unk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
i mean , this is just my logic ##al side talking .
so imagine if you ' re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
how would your consciousness handle your body being del ##oc ##al ##ized in space ?
there ' s one more part to the story .
it ' s when we warm ##ed it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elev ##ator are really just quantum objects just cra ##mm ##ed into a tiny space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechan ##ics says that everything is all inter ##conne ##cted .
well , that ' s not quite right .
it ' s more than that ; it ' s deeper .
it ' s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that ' s the profound weird ##ness of quantum mechan ##ics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to recon ##cept ##ual ##ize how we thought about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand ##ful of different cities that were all compet ##ing to attract new res ##idents .
now we ' re a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don ' t have even a single city that would be willing to wel ##come them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they ' re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
so we could easily supply the world with dozen ##s , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now this might sound pre ##po ##ster ##ous to you if you ' ve never thought about new cities .
but just subst ##it ##ute apartment building for cities .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartment ##s already had them ; the other half aren ' t there yet .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing addition ##s on all the existing apartment ##s .
but you know what you ' d run into is those apartment ##s and the surround ##ing areas have rules to avoid disc ##om ##fort and the distr ##action ##s of construction .
so it ' s extremely hard to do all of those addition ##s .
but you could go out some ##place brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that fac ##il ##ita ##ted construction rather than getting in the way .
so i prop ##osed that governments create new reform zone ##s big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : chart ##er cities .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja ##v ##ier and oct ##av ##io were thinking about the challenge of reform in hon ##du ##ras .
they knew that about 75 , 000 hon ##du ##ra ##ns every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in hon ##du ##ras .
at one point , ja ##v ##ier said to oct ##av ##io , " what if we took some of our empty land - - what if we just gave it to an em ##bas ##sy - - give some to the u . s . em ##bas ##sy ; give some to the can ##ad ##ian em ##bas ##sy - - and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those em ##bas ##sy ground ##s that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u . s . to do ? "
in the summer of 2009 , hon ##du ##ras went through a wr ##ench ##ing const ##itution ##al crisis .
at the next regular ##ly sche ##du ##led election , pe ##pe lob ##o won in a land ##sl ##ide on a platform that promise ##d reform , but recon ##cil ##iation as well .
he asked oct ##av ##io to be his chief of staff .
mean ##wh ##ile , i was getting ready to give a talk at ted ##gl ##ob ##al .
through a process of ref ##ine ##ment , trial and error , a lot of user testing , i tried to bo ##il this complicated concept of chart ##er city down to the bare essential ##s .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can ' t come in and dist ##ur ##b all the existing apartment hold ##ers .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it ' s usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu ##ate ##mal ##a sent oct ##av ##io a link to the tedtalk .
he showed it to ja ##v ##ier .
they called me .
they said , " let ' s present this to the leaders of our country . "
so in dec ##ember we met in mi ##ami , in a hotel conference room .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that ' s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , oct ##av ##io said , " paul , maybe we could watch the tedtalk . "
so the tedtalk la ##id out in very simple terms , a chart ##er city is a place where you start with uni ##n ##hab ##ited land , a chart ##er that spec ##if ##ies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of hon ##du ##ras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
i was asked to come to te ##gu ##ci ##gal ##pa and talk again on janu ##ary fourth and fifth .
so i presented another fact - filled lecture that include ##d a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
this is a picture of den ##ver , and the out ##line is the new airport that was built in den ##ver .
this airport alone cover ##s more than 100 square kilometers .
so i was trying to persu ##ade the hon ##du ##ra ##ns , if you build a new city , you ' ve got to start with a site that ' s at least 1 , 000 square kilometers .
that ' s more than 250 hundred - thousand ac ##res .
everybody appl ##au ##ded polit ##el ##y .
the faces in the audience were very serious and att ##ent ##ive .
the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , " professor rom ##er , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the tedtalk .
i ' ve got it here on my laptop . "
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and it got to the essen ##ce , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon ##du ##ras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
because the leaders in the government there in hon ##du ##ras would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this chart ##er and the en ##for ##ce ##ment , so everybody can trust that the chart ##er really will be en ##for ##ced .
and the insight of president lob ##o was that that ass ##urance of en ##for ##ce ##ment that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign invest ##ors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different part ##ies in hon ##du ##ras who had suffer ##ed for so many years from fear and distr ##ust .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture ' s from there .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
and short ##ly there ##af ##ter , on janu ##ary 19th , they vote ##d in the congress to ame ##nd their const ##itution to have a const ##itution ##al prov ##ision that allows for special development regions .
in a country which had just gone through this wr ##ench ##ing crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this const ##itution ##al ame ##nd ##ment was 12 ##4 to one .
all part ##ies , all fact ##ions in society , back ##ed this .
to be part of the const ##itution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
on febru ##ary 17 ##th they passed it again with another vote of 11 ##4 to one .
immediately after that vote , on febru ##ary 21st to the 24 ##th , a del ##e ##ga ##t ##ion of about 30 hon ##du ##ra ##ns went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
one is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that ' s being built in south korea - - bigger than down ##to ##wn boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per ##mit ##s .
the other place that ' s very interested in city building is sing ##ap ##ore .
they ' ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar ##ing the third .
so if you think about this practical ##ly , here ' s where we are .
they ' ve got a site ; they ' re already thinking about this site for the second city .
they ' re putting in place a legal system that could allow for manager ##s to come in , and also an ext ##ern ##al legal system .
one country has already volunte ##ered to let its su ##pre ##me court be the court of final app ##e ##al for the new jud ##ic ##ial system there .
there ' s designers and build ##ers of cities who are very interested .
they even can bring with them some financ ##ing .
but the one thing you know they ' ve already solved is that there ' s lots of ten ##ants .
there ' s lots of businesses that would like to loc ##ate in the america ##s , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there ' s lots of people who ' d like to go there .
around the world , there ' s 700 million people who say they ' d like to move permanent ##ly some ##place else right now .
there ' s a million a year who leave lat ##in america to go to the united states .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job - - sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or cloth ##ing .
sad ##ly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re ##un ##ited with their parents that they haven ' t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in hon ##du ##ras ?
or to build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about ins ##ist ##ing that every family have a choice of several cities that are compet ##ing to attract new res ##idents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends from hon ##du ##ras asked me to say thank you , ted .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
i recently did a survey with over 2 , 000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american report ##s making is about 70 in a typical day .
there was also recently a study done with ce ##os in which they followed ce ##os around for a whole week .
and these scientists simply document ##ed all the various task ##s that these ce ##os engaged in and how much time they spent engag ##ing in making decisions related to these task ##s .
and they found that the average ce ##o engaged in about 13 ##9 task ##s in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub - choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
think about your own choices .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ ##ory versus your one hour categ ##ory ?
how well do you think you ' re doing at manag ##ing those choices ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day cho ##osing problems that we have , which is the choice over ##load problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
now as i talk about this problem , i ' m going to have some questions for you and i ' m going to want to know your answers .
so when i ask you a question , since i ' m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal ##ories .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over ##load problem ?
thank you .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very up ##sc ##ale gro ##cer ##y store ; at least at that time it was truly up ##sc ##ale .
it was a store called dra ##e ##ger ' s .
now this store , it was almost like going to an am ##use ##ment park .
they had 250 different kinds of must ##ards and vi ##ne ##gar ##s and over 500 different kinds of fr ##uits and veget ##ables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottle ##d water - - and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasion i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
here ' s their ol ##ive oil a ##isl ##e .
they had over 75 different kinds of ol ##ive oil , including those that were in a loc ##ked case that came from thousand - year - old ol ##ive trees .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and i asked the manager , " is this model of offer ##ing people all this choice really working ? "
and he point ##ed to the bus ##load ##s of tour ##ists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
here ' s their jam a ##isl ##e .
they had 3 ##4 ##8 different kinds of jam .
we set up a little tast ##ing boot ##h right near the ent ##ra ##n ##ce of the store .
we there put out six different fl ##avor ##s of jam or 24 different fl ##avor ##s of jam , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some jam ?
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a ja ##r of jam .
now we see the opposite effect .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a ja ##r of jam .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a ja ##r of jam .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a ja ##r of jam if they encounter ##ed six than if they encounter ##ed 24 .
now cho ##osing not to buy a ja ##r of jam is probably good for us - - at least it ' s good for our wa ##ist ##lines - - but it turns out that this choice over ##load problem affect ##s us even in very consequen ##t ##ial decisions .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self - interests .
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
now i ' m going to describe to you a study i did with gur hub ##er ##man , em ##ir kamen ##ica , wei jan ##g where we looked at the ret ##ire ##ment savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 65 ##0 plans all in the u . s .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offer ##ings available in a ret ##ire ##ment savings plan , the 40 ##1 plan , does that affect people ' s like ##li ##hood to save more for tomorrow .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correl ##ation .
so in these plans , we had about 65 ##7 plans that range ##d from offer ##ing people anywhere from two to 5 ##9 different fund offer ##ings .
and what we found was that , the more fund ##s offered , indeed , there was less particip ##ation rate .
so if you look at the extreme ##s , those plans that offered you two fund ##s , particip ##ation rates were around in the mid - 70s - - still not as high as we want it to be .
in those plans that offered nearly 60 fund ##s , particip ##ation rates have now dropped to about the 60 ##th percent ##ile .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stock ##s or equ ##ity fund ##s .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market account ##s .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would rec ##ommen ##d for people when you ' re consider ##ing their future financial well - being .
well , over the past decade , we have observ ##ed three main negative consequences to offer ##ing people more and more choices .
they ' re more likely to del ##ay cho ##osing - - pro ##c ##ras ##t ##ina ##te even when it goes against their best self - interest .
they ' re more likely to make worse choices - - worse financial choices , medical choices .
they ' re more likely to choose things that make them less satisf ##ied , even when they do object ##ively better .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga ##zing at those giant walls of may ##on ##na ##ises , must ##ards , vi ##ne ##gar ##s , jam ##s , but we can ' t actually do the math of compar ##ing and contrast ##ing and actually pick ##ing from that stun ##ning display .
so what i want to prop ##ose to you today are four simple techniques - - techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research ven ##ues - - that you can easily apply in your businesses .
the first : cut .
you ' ve heard it said before , but it ' s never been more true than today , that less is more .
people are always up ##set when i say , " cut . "
they ' re always worried they ' re going to lose shel ##f space .
but in fact , what we ' re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extra ##ne ##ous redu ##nd ##ant options , well there ' s an increase in sal ##es , there ' s a lower ##ing of costs , there is an improve ##ment of the cho ##osing experience .
when pro ##ctor & amp ; gam ##ble went from 26 different kinds of head & amp ; shoulder ##s to 15 , they saw an increase in sal ##es by 10 percent .
when the golden cat corpor ##ation got rid of their 10 worst - selling cat litt ##er products , they saw an increase in profit ##s by 8 ##7 percent - - a function of both increase in sal ##es and lower ##ing of costs .
you know , the average gro ##cer ##y store today offer ##s you 45 , 000 products .
the typical wal ##mar ##t today offer ##s you 100 , 000 products .
but the nin ##th largest ret ##ail ##er , the nin ##th biggest ret ##ail ##er in the world today is al ##di , and it offer ##s you only 1 , 400 products - - one kind of cann ##ed tom ##at ##o sau ##ce .
now in the financial savings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offer ##ings has actually been something that david la ##ib ##son was heav ##ily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
every single harvard employe ##e is now automatically en ##roll ##ed in a life ##cy ##cle fund .
for those people who actually want to choose , they ' re given 20 fund ##s , not 300 or more fund ##s .
you know , often , people say , " i don ' t know how to cut .
they ' re all important choices . "
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , " tell me how these choices are different from one another .
and if your employees can ' t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . "
now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a cha ##t with gar ##y .
and gar ##y said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all - exp ##ens ##es - paid free vac ##ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here ' s a descri ##ption of the road .
and i ' d like you to read it .
and now i ' ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to cla ##p your hands if you ' re ready to take gar ##y up on his offer .
okay . anybody who ' s ready to take him up on his offer .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn ' t you .
now who ' s ready to go on this trip .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
all right .
now in fact , you had object ##ively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would vent ##ure to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
which brings me to the second technique for hand ##ling the choice over ##load problem , which is conc ##ret ##ization .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi ##v ##id sort of way , in a very concrete way .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash ?
because it doesn ' t feel like real money .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
so a study that i did with sh ##lo ##mo ben ##art ##zi and al ##ess ##and ##ro prev ##iter ##o , we did a study with people at ing - - employees that are all working at ing - - and now these people were all in a session where they ' re doing en ##roll ##ment for their 40 ##1 plan .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en ##roll ##ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
the third technique : categ ##or ##ization .
we can handle more categ ##ories than we can handle choices .
so for example , here ' s a study we did in a magazine a ##isl ##e .
it turns out that in weg ##man ##s gro ##cer ##y store ##s up and down the north ##e ##ast cor ##ri ##do ##r , the magazine a ##isl ##es range anywhere from 33 ##1 different kinds of magazine ##s all the way up to 6 ##6 ##4 .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazine ##s and i divide them up into 10 categ ##ories , versus i show you 400 magazine ##s and divide them up into 20 categ ##ories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better cho ##osing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
because the categ ##ories tell me how to tell them apart .
here are two different jewe ##l ##ry display ##s .
one is called " jazz " and the other one is called " sw ##ing . "
if you think the display on the left is sw ##ing and the display on the right is jazz , cla ##p your hands .
okay , there ' s some .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is sw ##ing , cla ##p your hands .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you ' re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is sw ##ing , but you know what ?
this is a highly use ##less categ ##or ##ization sche ##me .
the categ ##ories need to say something to the choose ##r , not the choice - make ##r .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long list ##s of all these fund ##s .
who are they actually supposed to be inform ##ing ?
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we ' ve just got to take it a little easier .
we have to gradu ##ally increase the complexity .
i ' m going to show you one example of what i ' m talking about .
let ' s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
here ' s a german car manufact ##urer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car .
you ' ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions var ##y in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
car colors , ext ##er ##ior car colors - - i ' ve got 5 ##6 choices .
engine ##s , ge ##ars ##hi ##ft - - four choices .
so now what i ' m going to do is i ' m going to var ##y the order in which these decisions appear .
so half of the custom ##ers are going to go from high choice , 5 ##6 car colors , to low choice , four ge ##ars ##hi ##ft ##s .
the other half of the custom ##ers are going to go from low choice , four ge ##ars ##hi ##ft ##s , to 5 ##6 car colors , high choice .
what am i going to look at ?
how engaged you are .
if you keep hit ##ting the def ##ault button per decision , that means you ' re getting overwhel ##med , that means i ' m losing you .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they ' re hit ##ting that def ##ault button over and over and over again .
we ' re losing them .
they go from low choice to high choice , they ' re hang ##ing in there .
it ' s the same information . it ' s the same number of choices .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari ##ed the order in which that information is presented .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
even though cho ##osing ge ##ars ##hi ##ft doesn ' t tell me anything about my prefer ##ence ##s for inter ##ior dec ##or , it still prepar ##es me for how to choose .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i ' m putting together , so i ' m more willing to be motiv ##ated to be engaged .
so let me rec ##ap .
i have talked about four techniques for mit ##ig ##ating the problem of choice over ##load - - cut - - get rid of the extra ##ne ##ous alternative ##s ; conc ##ret ##ize - - make it real ; categ ##or ##ize - - we can handle more categ ##ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
all of these techniques that i ' m describ ##ing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices - - better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serv ##ing .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be cho ##os ##y about cho ##osing .
and the more we ' re able to be cho ##os ##y about cho ##osing the better we will be able to practice the art of cho ##osing .
thank you very much .
hi . i ' m kevin all ##oc ##ca , i ' m the trends manager at youtube , and i professional ##ly watch youtube videos .
it ' s true .
so we ' re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vir ##al and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars - - celebr ##ities , sing ##ers , come ##di ##ans - - and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world ' s culture .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next sat ##ur ##day .
but there are over 48 hours of video up ##load ##ed to youtube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vir ##al and gets tons of view ##s and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
three things : taste ##ma ##ker ##s , communities of particip ##ation and unexpected ##ness .
all right , let ' s go .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
woo ##o !
oh ##hh ##hh , wow ##w ##w ##w !
last year , bear v ##as ##que ##z post ##ed this video that he had shot outside his home in y ##ose ##mit ##e national park .
in 2010 , it was view ##ed 23 million times .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he didn ' t actually set out to make a vir ##al video , bear .
he just wanted to share a rain ##bo ##w .
because that ' s what you do when your name is y ##ose ##mit ##e mountain bear .
and he had post ##ed lots of nature videos in fact .
and this video had actually been post ##ed all the way back in janu ##ary .
so what happened here ?
jim ##m ##y k ##imm ##el actually .
jim ##m ##y k ##imm ##el post ##ed this twe ##et that would eventually prop ##el the video to be as popular as it would become .
because taste ##ma ##ker ##s like jim ##m ##y k ##imm ##el introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
it ' s fr ##iday , fr ##iday . gott ##a get down on fr ##iday . everybody ' s looking forward to the week ##end , week ##end . fr ##iday , fr ##iday . get ##t ##in ' down on fr ##iday . so you didn ' t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
re ##be ##cc ##a black ' s " fr ##iday " is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it ' s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and similar to " double rain ##bo ##w , " it seems to have just spr ##out ##ed up out of nowhere .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a fr ##iday , this is true .
and if you ' re wondering about those other sp ##ikes , those are also fr ##iday ##s .
but what about this day , this one particular fr ##iday ?
well to ##sh . 0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
michael j . nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
but what ' s important is that an individual or a group of taste ##ma ##ker ##s took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler ##ating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and now there are 10 , 000 par ##odies of " fr ##iday " on youtube .
even in the first seven days , there was one par ##ody for every other day of the week .
unlike the one - way entertainment of the 20th century , this community particip ##ation is how we become a part of the phenomenon - - either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
so " n ##yan cat " is a loop ##ed animation with loop ##ed music .
it ' s this , just like this .
it ' s been view ##ed nearly 50 million times this year .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three - hour version of this that ' s been view ##ed four million times .
even cat ##s were watching this video .
cat ##s were watching other cat ##s watch this video .
but what ' s important here is the creativity that it inspired among ##st this tech ##ie , gee ##ky internet culture .
there were rem ##ix ##es .
someone made an old time ##y version .
and then it went international .
an entire rem ##ix community spr ##out ##ed up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
because we don ' t just enjoy now , we participate .
and who could have predict ##ed any of this ?
who could have predict ##ed " double rain ##bo ##w " or re ##be ##cc ##a black or " n ##yan cat ? "
what script ##s could you have written that would have contain ##ed this in it ?
in a world where over two days of video get up ##load ##ed every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protest ##ing bicycle fine ##s in new york city , i admit i wasn ' t very interested .
so i got a tick ##et for not rid ##ing in the bike la ##ne , but often there are obst ##ru ##ctions that keep you from properly rid ##ing in the bike la ##ne .
by being totally surprising and humor ##ous , case ##y nie ##sta ##t got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and so this approach hold ##s for anything new that we do creative ##ly .
and so it all brings us to one big question . . .
what does this mean ?
oh ##hh ##h .
what does it mean ?
taste ##ma ##ker ##s , creative particip ##ating communities , complete unexpected ##ness , these are character ##istics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience define ##s the popular ##ity .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , just ##in bie ##ber , got his start on youtube .
no one has to green - light your idea .
and we all now feel some owners ##hip in our own pop culture .
and these are not character ##istics of old media , and they ' re bare ##ly true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bond ##s of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bond ##s took hold in the life of a four - year - old girl hu ##d ##dle ##d with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and night ##s in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bond ##s that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go - - that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a j ##ig ##sa ##w puzzle still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life ' s work .
he is a poet , a play ##w ##right , a man whose whole life had been balance ##d on the single hope of his country ' s unit ##y and freedom .
imagine him as the commun ##ists enter sa ##ig ##on , conf ##ron ##ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
words , for so long his friends , now mo ##cked him .
he ret ##reat ##ed into silence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grandfather .
i never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my dut ##y was not to allow it to have been in v ##ain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cru ##sh us , but we end ##ured .
the next piece of the j ##ig ##sa ##w is of a boat in the early da ##wn sl ##ipping sil ##ently out to sea .
my mother , ma ##i , was 18 when her father died - - already in an arrang ##ed marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life had dist ##illed itself into one task : the esc ##ape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was inc ##on ##ce ##iv ##able to her that she would not succeed .
so after a four - year sag ##a that def ##ies fiction , a boat sl ##ipped out to sea dis ##gu ##ised as a fishing vessel .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was of pir ##ates , rap ##e and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of po ##ison .
if we were capture ##d , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
my first memories are from the boat - - the ste ##ad ##y beat of the engine , the bow di ##pping into each wave , the vast and empty horiz ##on .
i don ' t remember the pir ##ates who came many times , but were bl ##uf ##fe ##d by the bra ##va ##do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fail ##ing to start for six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the mal ##ays ##ian coast and the young man who collapse ##d and died , the journey ' s end too much for him , and the first apple i taste ##d , given to me by the men on the rig .
no apple has ever taste ##d the same .
after three months in a ref ##uge ##e camp , we land ##ed in mel ##bo ##urn ##e .
and the next piece of the j ##ig ##sa ##w is about four women across three generations shap ##ing a new life together .
we sett ##led in foot ##sc ##ray , a working - class sub ##ur ##b whose demograph ##ic is layer ##s of imm ##ig ##ra ##nt ##s .
unlike the sett ##led middle - class sub ##ur ##bs , whose existence i was ob ##li ##vious of , there was no sense of ent ##it ##lement in foot ##sc ##ray .
the smell ##s from shop door ##s were from the rest of the world .
and the sn ##ippe ##ts of halt ##ing english were exchange ##d between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother worked on farm ##s , then on a car assem ##bly line , working six days , double shift ##s .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qual ##ification ##s .
we were poor .
all the dollars were all ##oc ##ated and extra tu ##ition in english and mathematics was budget ##ed for regard ##less of what miss ##ed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always second ##hand .
two pair ##s of stock ##ings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
a school uni ##form down to the an ##kle ##s , because it had to last for six years .
and there were rare but sea ##ring cha ##nt ##s of " sl ##it - eye " and the occasion ##al graf ##f ##iti : " asia ##n , go home . "
go home to where ?
something st ##iffen ##ed inside me .
there was a gather ##ing of res ##ol ##ve and a quiet voice saying , " i will by ##pass you . "
my mother , my sister and i sle ##pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex ##haus ##ted each night , but we told one another about our day and listen ##ed to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
my mother suffer ##ed from night ##mar ##es all about the boat .
and my job was to stay aw ##ake until her night ##mar ##es came so i could wake her .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beaut ##ician and opened another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angr ##y and infl ##e ##x ##ible , and trouble ##d children caught between two worlds .
gra ##nt ##s and spons ##ors were sou ##ght .
centers were establ ##ished .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asia ##n student , rele ##nt ##less in the demand ##s that i made on myself .
in the other , i was en ##me ##sh ##ed in lives that were prec ##ario ##us , trag ##ically scar ##red by violence , drug ab ##use and isol ##ation .
but so many over the years were helped .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was chose ##n as the young australia ##n of the year .
and i was cat ##ap ##ult ##ed from one piece of the j ##ig ##sa ##w to another , and their edge ##s didn ' t fit .
ta ##n le , anonym ##ous foot ##sc ##ray res ##ident , was now ta ##n le , ref ##uge ##e and social activ ##ist , invited to speak in ven ##ues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagine ##d .
i didn ' t know the proto ##col ##s .
i didn ' t know how to use the cut ##ler ##y .
i didn ' t know how to talk about wine .
i didn ' t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to ret ##reat to the rout ##ines and comfort of life in an uns ##ung sub ##ur ##b - - a grandmother , a mother and two daughter ##s end ##ing each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling as ##le ##ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
i told my mother i couldn ' t do it .
she remind ##ed me that i was now the same age she had been when we board ##ed the boat .
no had never been an option .
" just do it , " she said , " and don ' t be what you ' re not . "
so i spoke out on yout ##h une ##mp ##lo ##ym ##ent and education and the neg ##le ##ct of the mar ##gin ##al ##ized and the dise ##n ##fr ##anc ##hi ##sed .
and the more candid ##ly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the front ##iers of possibility .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not sett ##le into a career in law .
there had to be another piece of the j ##ig ##sa ##w .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outside ##r , a recent arr ##ival , new on the scene - - and not just okay , but something to be thank ##ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
because being an inside ##r can so easily mean coll ##aps ##ing the horiz ##ons , can so easily mean accept ##ing the pres ##ump ##t ##ions of your prov ##in ##ce .
i have step ##ped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were out ##rage ##ously encourage ##d .
there was an energy there , an impl ##ac ##able optim ##ism , a strange mix ##t ##ure of hum ##ility and darin ##g .
so i followed my hun ##ches .
i gather ##ed around me a small team of people for whom the lab ##el " it can ' t be done " was an irre ##s ##ist ##ible challenge .
for a year we were penn ##iles ##s .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of sou ##p which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
i made the decision to move to the u . s .
after only one trip .
my hun ##ches again .
three months later i had rel ##oc ##ated , and the advent ##ure has continued .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when conf ##uc ##ian ##ism was the social norm and the local mand ##ari ##n was the person who matter ##ed .
life hadn ' t changed for centuries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mand ##ari ##n whose mother beat her .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sens ##ation by taking him to court and pros ##ec ##uting her own case , and a far greater sens ##ation when she won .
" it can ' t be done " was shown to be wrong .
i was taking a show ##er in a hotel room in sy ##d ##ney the moment she died 600 miles away in mel ##bo ##urn ##e .
i looked through the show ##er screen and saw her standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say good ##by ##e .
my mother phone ##d minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a buddh ##ist tem ##ple in foot ##sc ##ray and sat around her cas ##ket .
we told her stories and ass ##ured her that we were still with her .
at mid ##n ##ight the mon ##k came and told us he had to close the cas ##ket .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the mon ##k , " why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? "
" because you have been holding it since this morning , " he said .
" you have not let it go . "
if there is a sin ##e ##w in our family , it runs through the women .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th ##wart ##ed us .
defe ##at would have come too easily .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
yet i am afraid of privileg ##e , of eas ##e , of ent ##it ##lement .
can i give them a bow in their lives , di ##pping bra ##vel ##y into each wave , the un ##per ##t ##ur ##bed and ste ##ad ##y beat of the engine , the vast horiz ##on that gu ##ara ##nte ##es nothing ?
i don ' t know .
but if i could give it and still see them safe ##ly through , i would .
and also , ta ##n ' s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
i ' m here to share my photograph ##y .
or is it photograph ##y ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can ' t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photograph ##y started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mix ##ed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trig ##ger .
so to me it felt like photograph ##y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
i felt like anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trig ##ger .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unexpected tw ##ist .
and despite that , it ret ##ains a level of real ##ism .
or photos like these - - both dark and color ##ful , but all with a common goal of ret ##aining the level of real ##ism .
when i say real ##ism , i mean photo - real ##ism .
because , of course , it ' s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been capture ##d somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it ' s more about capt ##uring an idea than about capt ##uring a moment really .
but what ' s the trick that makes it look real ##istic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two - dimensional surface .
it ' s not really what is real ##istic , it ' s what we think looks real ##istic really .
so i think the basic ##s are quite simple .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create altern ##ate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imag ##ina ##ble physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three - dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three - dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can ' t .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn ' t accept the fact that it doesn ' t really make sense .
and i see the same process with comb ##ining photographs .
it ' s just really about comb ##ining different real ##ities .
so the things that make a photograph look real ##istic , i think it ' s the things that we don ' t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when comb ##ining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a real ##istic result .
as you can see , these images aren ' t really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
second ##ly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both fu ##l ##fil ##l these two require ##ments - - shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to dist ##ingu ##ish where the different images begin and end by making it sea ##m ##less .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was comp ##osed .
so by match ##ing color , contrast and bright ##ness in the border ##s between the different images , add ##ing photograph ##ic defe ##cts like depth of field , des ##atur ##ated colors and noise , we era ##se the border ##s between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layer ##s basically .
so here ' s another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what ' s manipul ##ated .
but this image is actually entirely comp ##osed of photographs from different location ##s .
i personally think that it ' s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don ' t need to comp ##rom ##ise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different location ##s for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was capture ##d on a fishing trip .
the sh ##ores are from a different location .
the underwater part was capture ##d in a stone p ##it .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe ##di ##sh .
so to achieve a real ##istic result , i think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a sket ##ch , an idea .
then it ' s about comb ##ining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well plan ##ne ##d .
and if you do a good job capt ##uring the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real ##istic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why many e - health projects fail .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at rad ##bo ##ud university is we app ##o ##inted a chief listening office ##r .
not in a very scientific way - - she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relative ##s , " what ' s up ?
how could we help you ? "
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all - - maybe not all - - but most of the e - health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
this is my w ##if ##i scale . it ' s a very simple thing .
it ' s got one kn ##ob , on / off .
and every morning i hop on it .
and yes , i ' ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and i put my challenge on 95 k ##g .
but the thing is that it ' s made this simple that whenever i hop on , it send ##s my data through google health as well .
and it ' s collected by my general pract ##ition ##er as well , so he can see what ' s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need card ##iol ##og ##ic support or something like it , but also looking back ##ward .
but there ' s another thing .
as some of you might know , i ' ve got more than 4 , 000 follow ##ers on twitter .
so every morning i hop on my w ##if ##i scale and before i ' m in my car , people start talking to me , " i think you need a light lunch today , lu ##ci ##en . "
but that ' s the nice ##st thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients - - since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop sm ##oking in patients .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chair ##s and try to work together in some kind of gam ##ing activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be capt ##ain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , double ##d demand and things like that .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd - sou ##r ##cing .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
we ' ve all got navig ##ation control ##s in our car .
we maybe even [ have ] it in our cell ##phone .
we know perfectly where all the atm ##s are about the city of ma ##ast ##richt .
the other thing is we know where all the gas station ##s are .
and sure , we could find fast food chain ##s .
but where would be the near ##est a ##ed to help this patient ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the near ##est life - saving a ##ed was to be ob ##t ##ained right now .
so what we did , we crowd ##so ##ur ##ced the net ##her ##lands .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , " if you see an a ##ed , please sub ##mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it ' s open , " since sometimes in office hours sometimes it ' s closed , of course .
and over 10 , 000 a ##ed ##s already in the net ##her ##lands already have been sub ##mitt ##ed .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and we built an ip ##ad application .
we made an application for lay ##ar , aug ##mented reality , to find these a ##ed ##s .
and whenever you are in a city like ma ##ast ##richt and somebody collapse ##s , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cell ##phone , to find the near ##est a ##ed which can save lives .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as a ##ed ##4 ##e ##u , which is what the product is called , but also a ##ed ##4 ##us .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
and [ we ' re ] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleag ##ue univers ##ities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd - source all these a ##ed ##s all around the world .
that whenever you ' re on hol ##iday and somebody collapse ##s , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us val ##ida ##te these a ##ed ##s .
these might be cour ##ier services or ca ##ble guys for instance , just to see whether the a ##ed that ' s sub ##mitt ##ed still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
today i ' m going to talk about unexpected discover ##ies .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my small start ##up is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to . . .
. . . paying attention to crowd - sou ##r ##cing .
it ' s just a quick video of what we do .
hu ##h . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we ' ll just - - we can just ski ##p - - i ' ll just ski ##p through the video instead . . .
no .
this is not . . .
okay .
solar technology is . . .
oh , that ' s all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock ##star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they ' re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the program is called code for america , and it ' s a little bit like a peace cor ##ps for gee ##ks .
we sele ##ct a few fellow ##s every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wild ##s of city hall .
and there they make great app ##s , they work with city staff ##ers .
but really what they ' re doing is they ' re showing what ' s possible with technology today .
so meet al .
al is a fire hy ##dr ##ant in the city of boston .
here it kind of looks like he ' s looking for a date , but what he ' s really looking for is for someone to sh ##ove ##l him out when he gets snow ##ed in , because he knows he ' s not very good at fighting fire ##s when he ' s covered in four feet of snow .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique mann ##er ?
we had a team of fellow ##s in boston last year through the code for america program .
they were there in febru ##ary , and it snow ##ed a lot in febru ##ary last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to dig ##ging out these fire hy ##dr ##ants .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named er ##ik michael ##s - ober , noticed something else , and that ' s that citizens are sh ##ove ##ling out side ##wa ##l ##ks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good develop ##er would do , he wrote an app .
it ' s a cut ##e little app where you can adopt a fire hy ##dr ##ant .
so you agree to dig it out when it snow ##s .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and if you don ' t , someone can ste ##al it from you .
so it ' s got cut ##e little game dynamic ##s on it .
this is a mode ##st little app .
it ' s probably the small ##est of the 21 app ##s that the fellow ##s wrote last year .
but it ' s doing something that no other government technology does .
it ' s spreading vir ##ally .
there ' s a guy in the i . t . department of the city of hon ##ol ##ul ##u who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sir ##ens .
it ' s very important that these tsunami sir ##ens work , but people ste ##al the batterie ##s out of them .
so he ' s getting citizens to check on them .
and then seat ##t ##le decided to use it to get citizens to clear out cl ##og ##ged stor ##m dra ##ins .
and chicago just rolle ##d it out to get people to sign up to sh ##ove ##l side ##wa ##l ##ks when it snow ##s .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and this has spread just fr ##iction ##less ##ly , organic ##ally , naturally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn ' t how it normally goes .
pro ##c ##uring software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told after ##ward that if that had gone through normal channel ##s , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that ' s nothing .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost tax ##pa ##yers two billion dollars , and it doesn ' t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spread ##s vir ##ally , that ' s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
it suggests how government could work better - - not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means per ##mission ##less , it means open , it means gener ##ative .
and that ' s important .
but what ' s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tack ##ling the problem of government - - not as the problem of an os ##s ##ified institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that ' s great news , because , it turns out , we ' re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there ' s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it ' s not just code for america fellow ##s , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing c ##iv ##ic app ##s every day in their own communities .
they haven ' t given up on government .
they are frustr ##ated as hell with it , but they ' re not compl ##aining about it , they ' re fix ##ing it .
and these folks know something that we ' ve lost sight of .
and that ' s that when you str ##ip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the d ##m ##v and all those other things that we ' re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o ' rei ##lly , " what we do together that we can ' t do alone . "
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you ' re one of those people , i would ask that you recon ##side ##r , because things are changing .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
and because government ultimately der ##ives its power from us - - remember " we the people ? " - - how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now i didn ' t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elect ##ed to office .
well after two years , i ' ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about op ##oss ##ums .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it ' s generally where you will get if you call 31 ##1 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city ' s call center , as our fellow scott sil ##ver ##man did as part of the program - - in fact , they all do that - - you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an op ##oss ##um stuck in your house .
so scott gets this call .
he types " op ##oss ##um " into this official knowledge base .
he doesn ' t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and finally , he says , " look , can you just open all the door ##s to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? "
so that worked . so boo ##ya for scott .
but that wasn ' t the end of the op ##oss ##ums .
boston doesn ' t just have a call center .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
now we didn ' t write this app .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechan ##ics in boston .
so one day - - this is an actual report - - this came in : " op ##oss ##um in my tra ##sh ##can . can ' t tell if it ' s dead .
how do i get this remove ##d ? "
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
so scott was speaking person - to - person .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and the next report we got said , " i walked over to this location , found the tra ##sh ##can behind the house .
op ##oss ##um ? check . living ? ye ##p .
turned tra ##sh ##can on its side . walked home .
good ##n ##ight sweet op ##oss ##um . "
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it ' s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd - sou ##r ##cing game .
but it ' s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don ' t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i ' m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citi ##zen helped another citi ##zen , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they ' d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheap ##er alternative to government services .
when one neighbor helps another , we strength ##en our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it ' s not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that our input to the system of government is vot ##ing .
now how many times have we elect ##ed a political leader - - and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elect ##ed - - and then we sit back and we expect government to refle ##ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that ' s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six - inc ##h layer on top .
and what ' s under that is what we call bur ##e ##au ##c ##racy .
and we say that word with such contem ##pt .
but it ' s that contem ##pt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that ' s working against us , this other thing , and then we ' re dise ##mp ##ower ##ing ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sex ##y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we ' re going to have to make bur ##e ##au ##c ##racy sex ##y .
because that ' s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machine ##ry of government .
so that ' s occup ##y ##the ##se ##c movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it ' s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detail ##ed 32 ##5 - page report that ' s a response to the sec ' s requ ##est for comment on the financial reform bill .
that ' s not being political ##ly active , that ' s being bur ##e ##au ##c ##rat ##ically active .
now for those of us who ' ve given up on government , it ' s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they ' re going to face .
do we really think we ' re going to get where we need to go without fix ##ing the one institution that can act on beha ##l ##f of all of us ?
we can ' t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally refr ##ame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strength ##en ##ing civil society .
and there ' s a generation out there that ' s grown up on the internet , and they know that it ' s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
now the average age of our fellow ##s is 28 , so i am , begr ##ud ##ging ##ly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that ' s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gra ##nte ##d .
they ' re not fighting that battle that we ' re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
so when they ' re faced with the problem of government , they don ' t care as much about using their voices .
they ' re using their hands .
they ' re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be sh ##ove ##ling out a hy ##dr ##ant , pull ##ing a wee ##d , turning over a gar ##bage can with an op ##oss ##um in it .
and certainly , we could have been sh ##ove ##ling out those fire hy ##dr ##ants all along , and many people do .
but these app ##s are like little digital remind ##ers that we ' re not just consumers , and we ' re not just consumers of government , putting in our tax ##es and getting back services .
we ' re more than that , we ' re citizens .
and we ' re not going to fix government until we fix citizens ##hip .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jump ##s in technology that seem so fast that we can bare ##ly keep on top of it .
so i ' m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that ' s on .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my fil ##e .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris ##c micro ##pro ##cess ##ors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we ' re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se ##mi - log curve .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magn ##itude in performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se ##mi - log curve ##s .
something really weird is going on here .
and that ' s basically what i ' m going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i ' m just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology curve ##s in se ##mi - log curve ##s ?
well the answer is , if i dre ##w it on a normal curve where , let ' s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i ' m trying to graph , the graph ##s look sort of sil ##ly .
they sort of go like this .
and they don ' t tell us much .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a se ##mi - log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
but when something like this happens , things are qual ##ita ##t ##ively changing .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as micro ##pro ##cess ##or technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a tax ##i ca ##b and be in to ##ky ##o in 30 seconds .
it ' s not moving like that .
and there ' s nothing prec ##eden ##ted in the history of technology development of this kind of self - feeding growth where you go by order ##s of magn ##itude every few years .
now the question that i ' d like to ask is , if you look at these expon ##ential curve ##s , they don ' t go on forever .
things just can ' t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it ' s going to turn into a sort of classic ##al s - curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it ' s going to do this .
that ' s about all it can do .
now i ' m an optim ##ist , so i sort of think it ' s probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we ' re in the middle of right now is a transition .
we ' re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i ' m trying to ask , what i ' ve been asking myself , is what ' s this new way that the world is ?
what ' s that new state that the world is head ##ing toward ?
because the transition seems very , very conf ##us ##ing when we ' re right in the middle of it .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here ' s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
it ' s about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shr ##ink ##ing one year per year for my whole lifetime .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something ' s happening there .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just doesn ' t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything ' s going to be so different that a simple extra ##pol ##ation of what we ' re doing just doesn ' t make any sense at all .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we ' re going through .
now in order to do that i ' m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , ster ##ile hun ##k of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and i think that there ' s theorie ##s that are beginning to understand about how it started with r ##na , but i ' m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drop ##s of oil floating around with all kinds of different rec ##ipe ##s of chemicals in them .
and some of those drop ##s of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to inc ##or ##por ##ate chemicals from the outside and grow the drop ##s of oil .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
and those were the most prim ##itive forms of cells in a sense , those little drop ##s of oil .
but now those drop ##s of oil weren ' t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random rec ##ipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they got sort of une ##qu ##al div ##ision of the chemicals within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , the drop ##s that were different in a way that caused them to be better at inc ##or ##por ##ating chemicals around them , grew more and inc ##or ##por ##ated more chemicals and divided more .
so those tend ##ed to live longer , get express ##ed more .
now that ' s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drop ##s learned a trick about abstract ##ion .
somehow by ways that we don ' t quite understand , these little drop ##s learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the rec ##ipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mind ##less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop ##ied .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed ste ##ad ##y since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the rec ##ipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am ##use ##ment purpose ##s is we can now write things in this code .
and i ' ve got here a little 100 micro ##gra ##ms of white pow ##der , which i try not to let the security people see at airport ##s .
but this has in it - - what i did is i took this code - - the code has standard letters that we use for symbol ##izing it - - and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amp ##li ##f ##ied it 10 to the 22 times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop ##ies of my business card , i have ple ##nt ##y for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it ' s right here .
if i had really been a ego ##t ##ist , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
so what was the next step ?
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells - - that kept them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exch ##ang ##ing and communic ##ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
i don ' t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
now that ' s why , for instance , antibiot ##ic resistance has evolved .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen ##ic ##ill ##in , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resist ##ant to pen ##ic ##ill ##in , because bacteria communicate .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were syn ##erg ##istic .
so they survive ##d or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe ##ated more and they were favor ##ed by evolution .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole rec ##ipe for the community together on one string of dna .
and so the next stage that ' s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multi - cell ##ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and in fact , we ' re such a multi - cell ##ular community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
your skin cell is really use ##less without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so these communities began to evol ##ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the neur ##al structures .
so neurons are the information processing appar ##at ##us that those communities of cells built up .
and in fact , they began to get special ##ists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual - - learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fr ##uit because it taste ##d bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they ' d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolution ##arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fr ##uit .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen in learning time scale ##s .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communic ##ating .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we ' re aware of is human language .
it ' s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
here i have a very complicated , mess ##y , conf ##used idea in my head .
i ' m sitting here making gru ##nt ##ing sounds basically , and hopefully constru ##cting a similar mess ##y , conf ##used idea in your head that bear ##s some analog ##y to it .
but we ' re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequence ##s of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start function ##ing as a single organism .
and so , in fact , what we ' ve done is we , humanity , have started abstract ##ing out .
we ' re going through the same levels that multi - cell ##ular organisms have gone through - - abstract ##ing out our method ##s of recording , present ##ing , processing information .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
tele ##ph ##ony , computers , video ##t ##ape ##s , c ##d - rom ##s and so on are all our special ##ized mechanism ##s that we ' ve now built within our society for hand ##ling that information .
and it all connect ##s us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol ##ve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro ##se ##con ##ds .
and you saw ty ' s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the conv ##olution program right before your eyes .
so now we ' ve speed ##ed up the time scale ##s once again .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronic ##s , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess , auto ##ca ##t ##aly ##t ##ic is the word for it - - when something rein ##for ##ces its rate of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that that ' s what we ' re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
we ' re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanism ##s that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent adv ##ances in computers .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it ' s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
i don ' t know what every transist ##or in the connection machine does .
there are billions of them .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstract ##ion and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far ##ther and faster than we could ever do .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by method ##s that we don ' t quite even understand .
one method that ' s particularly interesting that i ' ve been using a lot late ##ly is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro ##se ##con ##d time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol ##ve a program by starting out with random sequence ##s of instru ##ctions .
say , " computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequence ##s of instru ##ctions .
now would you please run all of those random sequence ##s of instru ##ctions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came close ##st to doing what i wanted . "
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
let ' s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i ' ve done it with .
so find the programs that come close ##st to sort ##ing numbers .
so of course , random sequence ##s of instru ##ctions are very unlike ##ly to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and i say , " computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequence ##s that did the best job .
save those . kill off the rest .
and now let ' s reprodu ##ce the ones that sort ##ed numbers the best .
and let ' s reprodu ##ce them by a process of rec ##om ##bi ##na ##t ##ion analog ##ous to sex . "
take two programs and they produce children by exch ##ang ##ing their sub ##ro ##ut ##ines , and the children inher ##it the tra ##its of the sub ##ro ##ut ##ines of the two programs .
so i ' ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combination ##s of the programs that did a little bit better job .
say , " please repe ##at that process . "
score them again .
introduce some mut ##ations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those generations just takes a few mill ##ise ##con ##ds .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sort ##ing numbers .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
now if i look at those programs , i can ' t tell you how they work .
i ' ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they ' re obs ##c ##ure , weird programs .
but they do the job .
and in fact , i know , i ' m very conf ##ident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
in fact , their life depend ##ed on doing the job .
i was rid ##ing in a 7 ##4 ##7 with mar ##vin min ##sk ##y once , and he pull ##s out this card and says , " oh look . look at this .
it says , ' this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . ' doesn ' t that make you feel conf ##ident ? "
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn ' t work very well when it gets complicated .
so we ' re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that ' s very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don ' t quite understand the options of it .
so in a sense , it ' s getting ahead of us .
we ' re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we ' ll be able to run this process much faster .
so it ' s feeding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that ' s why i think it seems so conf ##us ##ing .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
we ' re taking off .
and what we are is we ' re at a point in time which is analog ##ous to when single - cell ##ed organisms were turning into multi - cell ##ed organisms .
so we ' re the am ##oe ##bas and we can ' t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we ' re creating .
we ' re right at that point of transition .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
i think it ' s very hau ##ght ##y of us to think that we ' re the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get sele ##cted out .
my story begins right here actually in ra ##ja ##sth ##an about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the star ##ry ski ##es with the su ##f ##i sing ##er mu ##k ##ht ##iar al ##i .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian ep ##ic " the ma ##hab ##har ##ata . "
so back in the day , when us indian ##s wanted to travel we ' d jump into a char ##iot and we ' d zoom across the sky .
now we do the same with airplane ##s .
back then , when ar ##j ##un ##a , the great indian war ##ri ##or princ ##e , when he was thir ##st ##y , he ' d take out a bow , he ' d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
now we do the same with dr ##ills and machines .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replace ##d by machine ##ry .
and this made me really sad .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a techn ##oph ##ob ##e .
i was terr ##ified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sun ##set without having my camera on me , without twe ##et ##ing it to my friends .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little sil ##ver pocket watch .
and this piece of 50 - year - old technology became the most magic ##al thing to me .
it became a g ##ild ##ed ga ##te ##way into a world full of pir ##ates and ship ##w ##re ##cks and images in my imagination .
so i felt like our cell ##phones and our fan ##cy watch ##es and our cameras had stopped us from dream ##ing .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so i jump ##ed in , i jump ##ed into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
i ' ve been illustr ##ating books since i was 16 .
and so when i saw the ip ##ad , i saw it as a storyte ##lling device that could connect read ##ers all over the world .
it can know how we ' re holding it .
it can know where we are .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
storyte ##lling is becoming more and more multi - sensor ##ial .
but what are we doing with it ?
so i ' m actually just going to go in and launch k ##ho ##ya , an interactive app for the ip ##ad .
so it says , " place your fingers upon each light . "
and so - - it says , " this box belong ##s to . . . " and so i type in my name .
and actually i become a character in the book .
at various points , a little letter drop ##s down to me - - and the ip ##ad knows where you live because of gps - - which is actually address ##ed to me .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
now i ' ve been talking a lot about magic .
and i don ' t mean w ##iz ##ards and drag ##ons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har ##bor ##ed as children .
this idea of fire ##fl ##ies in a ja ##r , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and so over here you need to t ##ilt your ip ##ad , take the fire ##fl ##ies out .
and they actually ill ##umin ##ate your way through the rest of the book .
another idea that really fascin ##ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contain ##ed within a single mar ##ble .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar ##ble that i drag in to this magic ##al device within the device .
and it open ##s up a map .
all along , all fantas ##y books have always had maps , but these maps have been stat ##ic .
this is a map that grows and glo ##ws and becomes your navig ##ation for the rest of the book .
it reve ##als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so i ' m just going to enter in .
another thing that ' s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contem ##por ##ary .
over here , these are the ap ##sa ##ras .
so we ' ve all heard about fair ##ies and we ' ve all heard about n ##ym ##ph ##s , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counter ##part ##s , the ap ##sa ##ras ?
these poor ap ##sa ##ras have been tra ##pped inside ind ##ra ' s cha ##m ##bers for thousands of years in an old and must ##y book .
and so we ' re bringing them back in a contem ##por ##ary story for children .
and a story that actually deal ##s with new issues like the environmental crisis .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been loc ##ked inside their rooms , gl ##ued to their pc ##s , they haven ' t been able to get out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
one of the interaction ##s in the book is that you ' re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the ip ##ad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
when i was a child , i had multiple collection ##s of sticks and stone ##s and pe ##b ##bles and shell ##s .
and somehow kids don ' t do that anymore .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar ##k and then tag that .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says , " oh , i saw a fox today . "
a child in india says , " i saw a monkey today . "
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you ' ve actually taken .
in the possibilities of link ##ing together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your ip ##ad out with the video on and through aug ##mented reality , you see this layer of anim ##ated p ##ix ##ies appear on a house ##plant that ' s outside your house .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
we ' re moving , we ' re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
we ' re har ##ness ##ing energy from the sun .
we ' re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time in ja ##ils , in prison ##s , on death row .
i spend most of my time in very low - income communities in the projects and places where there ' s a great deal of hope ##less ##ness .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimul ##ation , hearing it , has been very , very energ ##izing to me .
and one of the things that ' s emer ##ged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
and you can actually say things here that have impact ##s around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn ' t have when it doesn ' t .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and we ' ve had some fantastic presentation ##s .
and i think what we ' ve learned is that , if you ' re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you ' re a compassion ##ate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
if you ' re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you ' re a car ##ing doctor you can do some other things .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
and i didn ' t learn about this actually pract ##icing law and doing the work that i do .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was domin ##ated by a mat ##ria ##r ##ch , and that mat ##ria ##r ##ch was my grandmother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually ens ##la ##ved .
her parents were born in sla ##ver ##y in virginia in the 18 ##4 ##0 ' s .
she was born in the 18 ##8 ##0 ' s and the experience of sla ##ver ##y very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo ##ving .
when i would see her as a little boy , she ' d come up to me and she ' d give me these hu ##gs .
and she ' d sque ##e ##ze me so t ##ight i could bare ##ly breathe and then she ' d let me go .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she ' d come over to me and she ' d say , " br ##yan , do you still feel me hu ##g ##ging you ? "
and if i said , " no , " she ' d ass ##ault me again , and if i said , " yes , " she ' d leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the young ##est of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cous ##ins would be running around everywhere .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , wa ##king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cous ##ins were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room star ##ing at me .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and i would look at her and i ' d smile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , " come on , br ##yan . you and i are going to have a talk . "
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , " br ##yan , i ' m going to tell you something , but you don ' t tell anybody what i tell you . "
i said , " okay , mama . "
she said , " now you make sure you don ' t do that . " i said , " sure . "
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , " i want you to know i ' ve been watching you . "
and she said , " i think you ' re special . "
she said , " i think you can do anything you want to do . "
i will never forget it .
and then she said , " i just need you to promise me three things , br ##yan . "
i said , " okay , mama . "
she said , " the first thing i want you to promise me is that you ' ll always love your mom . "
she said , " that ' s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you ' ll always take care of her . "
well i ad ##ored my mom , so i said , " yes , mama . i ' ll do that . "
then she said , " the second thing i want you to promise me is that you ' ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . "
and i thought about it and i said , " yes , mama . i ' ll do that . "
then finally she said , " the third thing i want you to promise me is that you ' ll never drink al ##co ##hol . "
well i was nine years old , so i said , " yes , mama . i ' ll do that . "
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six - pack of beer - - i don ' t know where he got it - - and he grab ##bed me and my sister and we went out in the wood ##s .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra ##zil ##y did .
and he had a s ##ip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
i said , " no , no , no . that ' s okay . you all go ahead . i ' m not going to have any beer . "
my brother said , " come on . we ' re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . "
i said , " no , i don ' t feel right about that . y ' all go ahead . y ' all go ahead . "
and then my brother started star ##ing at me .
he said , " what ' s wrong with you ? have some beer . "
then he looked at me real hard and he said , " oh , i hope you ' re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . "
i said , " well , what are you talking about ? "
he said , " oh , mama tells all the grand ##ki ##ds that they ' re special . "
i was devast ##ated .
and i ' m going to admit something to you .
i ' m going to tell you something i probably shouldn ' t .
i know this might be broad ##cast broad ##ly .
but i ' m 5 ##2 years old , and i ' m going to admit to you that i ' ve never had a drop of al ##co ##hol .
i don ' t say that because i think that ' s virt ##u ##ous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don ' t actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don ' t think they can do .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand ##ki ##ds were special .
my grandfather was in prison during pro ##hib ##ition .
my male unc ##les died of al ##co ##hol - related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
well i ' ve been trying to say something about our cr ##iminal justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 197 ##2 , there were 300 , 000 people in ja ##ils and prison ##s .
today , there are 2 . 3 million .
the united states now has the highest rate of inc ##ar ##cer ##ation in the world .
we have seven million people on prob ##ation and par ##ole .
and mass inc ##ar ##cer ##ation , in my jud ##gment , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this desp ##air , there is this hope ##less ##ness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja ##il , in prison , on prob ##ation or par ##ole .
in urban communities across this country - - los angeles , phil ##adel ##ph ##ia , bal ##t ##im ##ore , washington - - 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja ##il or prison or on prob ##ation or par ##ole .
our system isn ' t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be dist ##ort ##ing around race , they ' re also dist ##orted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that treat ##s you much better if you ' re rich and gu ##ilt ##y than if you ' re poor and inno ##cent .
wealth , not c ##ul ##pa ##bil ##ity , shapes outcomes .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we ' ve been disc ##on ##ne ##cted .
it ' s interesting to me .
we ' re looking at some very interesting development ##s in our work .
my state of al ##ab ##ama , like a number of states , actually permanent ##ly dise ##n ##fr ##anc ##hi ##ses you if you have a cr ##iminal conv ##iction .
right now in al ##ab ##ama 3 ##4 percent of the black male population has permanent ##ly lost the right to vote .
we ' re actually project ##ing in another 10 years the level of dise ##n ##fr ##anc ##hi ##sem ##ent will be as high as it ' s been since prior to the pass ##age of the vot ##ing rights act .
and there is this stun ##ning silence .
i represent children .
a lot of my cl ##ients are very young .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13 - year - old children to die in prison .
we have life impr ##ison ##ment without par ##ole for kids in this country .
and we ' re actually doing some lit ##ig ##ation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people on death row .
it ' s interesting , this question of the death pen ##alt ##y .
in many ways , we ' ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deser ##ve to die for the crime ##s they ' ve commit ##ted ?
and that ' s a very sens ##ible question .
but there ' s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deser ##ve to die for the crime ##s they commit , but do we deser ##ve to kill ?
i mean , it ' s fascinating .
death pen ##alt ##y in america is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been exec ##uted , we ' ve actually identif ##ied one inno ##cent person who ' s been ex ##one ##rate ##d and released from death row .
a kind of astonishing error rate - - one out of nine people inno ##cent .
i mean , it ' s fascinating .
in av ##iation , we would never let people fly on airplane ##s if for every nine plane ##s that took off one would crash .
but somehow we can insul ##ate ourselves from this problem .
it ' s not our problem .
it ' s not our bur ##den .
it ' s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deser ##ve to kill .
and it ' s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about sla ##ver ##y .
i tell them about terror ##ism , the era that began at the end of recon ##stru ##ction that went on to world war ii .
we don ' t really know very much about it .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being l ##yn ##ched .
they had to worry about being bomb ##ed .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , " mr . steven ##son , you give talks , you make speech ##es , you tell people to stop saying we ' re dealing with terror ##ism for the first time in our nation ' s history after 9 / 11 . "
they tell me to say , " no , tell them that we grew up with that . "
and that era of terror ##ism , of course , was followed by se ##greg ##ation and decades of ra ##cial sub ##ordin ##ation and apart ##he ##id .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don ' t like to talk about our problems .
we don ' t like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven ' t understood what it ' s meant to do the things we ' ve done histor ##ically .
we ' re constantly running into each other .
we ' re constantly creating tens ##ions and conflict ##s .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it ' s because we are unw ##illing to commit ourselves to a process of truth and recon ##cil ##iation .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn ' t over ##come apart ##he ##id without a commitment to truth and recon ##cil ##iation .
in rwanda , even after the gen ##oc ##ide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven ' t done that .
i was giving some lecture ##s in germany about the death pen ##alt ##y .
it was fascinating because one of the scho ##la ##r ##s stood up after the presentation and said , " well you know it ' s deeply trou ##bling to hear what you ' re talking about . "
he said , " we don ' t have the death pen ##alt ##y in germany .
and of course , we can never have the death pen ##alt ##y in germany . "
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , " there ' s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systemat ##ic killing of human beings .
it would be unc ##ons ##ci ##ona ##ble for us to , in an intention ##al and del ##iber ##ate way , set about exec ##uting people . "
and i thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was exec ##uting people , especially if they were disp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ately jew ##ish ?
i couldn ' t bear it .
it would be unc ##ons ##ci ##ona ##ble .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we exec ##ute people - - where you ' re 11 times more likely to get the death pen ##alt ##y if the vict ##im is white than if the vict ##im is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defen ##da ##nt is black and the vict ##im is white - - in the very states where there are bur ##ied in the ground the bodies of people who were l ##yn ##ched .
and yet , there is this disc ##on ##ne ##ct .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
that when we actually don ' t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are none ##the ##less implic ##ated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , those real ##ities are shad ##ow ##ed by suffering , ab ##use , deg ##rad ##ation , mar ##gin ##al ##ization .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integr ##ate the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hope ##ful , more commit ##ted , more ded ##icated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the dis ##ad ##vant ##aged , those who will never get to ted .
but thinking about them in a way that is integr ##ated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven ' t seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit ##ted to intellect as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fuel ##ed by some conv ##iction in our heart .
and it ' s that mind - heart connection that i believe comp ##els us to not just be att ##ent ##ive to all the bright and da ##zz ##ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
vac ##la ##v have ##l , the great c ##ze ##ch leader , talked about this .
he said , " when we were in eastern europe and dealing with opp ##ress ##ion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orient ##ation of the spirit , a willing ##ness to sometimes be in hope ##less places and be a witness . "
well that orient ##ation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
there is no disc ##on ##ne ##ct around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exc ##lu ##s ##ion , to unf ##air ##ness , to inj ##ust ##ice .
now i will war ##n you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don ' t pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
i had the great privileg ##e , when i was a young law ##yer , of meeting ros ##a parks .
and m ##s . parks used to come back to mont ##go ##mer ##y every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de ##are ##st friends , these older women , john ##n ##ie car ##r who was the organ ##izer of the mont ##go ##mer ##y bus boy ##co ##tt - - amazing african american woman - - and virginia dur ##r , a white woman , whose husband , cl ##iff ##ord dur ##r , represent ##ed dr . king .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then m ##s . car ##r would call me , and she ' d say , " br ##yan , m ##s . parks is coming to town . we ' re going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? "
and i ' d say , " yes , ma ' am , i do . "
and she ' d say , " well what are you going to do when you get here ? "
i said , " i ' m going to listen . "
and i ' d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
it would be so energ ##izing and so empower ##ing .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours m ##s . parks turned to me and she said , " now br ##yan , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
tell me what you ' re trying to do . "
and i began giving her my rap .
i said , " well we ' re trying to challenge inj ##ust ##ice .
we ' re trying to help people who have been wrong ##ly conv ##icted .
we ' re trying to conf ##ron ##t bi ##as and disc ##ri ##min ##ation in the administ ##ration of cr ##iminal justice .
we ' re trying to end life without par ##ole sentence ##s for children .
we ' re trying to do something about the death pen ##alt ##y .
we ' re trying to reduce the prison population .
we ' re trying to end mass inc ##ar ##cer ##ation . "
i gave her my whole rap , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , " m ##mm m ##mm m ##mm . "
she said , " that ' s going to make you t ##ired , t ##ired , t ##ired . "
and that ' s when m ##s . car ##r lea ##ne ##d forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , " that ' s why you ' ve got to be bra ##ve , bra ##ve , bra ##ve . "
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courage ##ous .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone ' s humanity .
i ' ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it ' s just taught me very simple things .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we ' ve ever done .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they ' re not just a li ##ar .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn ' t belong to them , they ' re not just a th ##ief .
i think even if you kill someone , you ' re not just a killer .
and because of that there ' s this basic human dign ##ity that must be respect ##ed by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don ' t believe that .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimul ##ating , we will ultimately not be judge ##d by our technology , we won ' t be judge ##d by our design , we won ' t be judge ##d by our intellect and reason .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileg ##ed , but by how they treat the poor , the cond ##em ##ne ##d , the inc ##ar ##cer ##ated .
because it ' s in that ne ##x ##us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
i sometimes get out of balance . i ' ll end with this story .
i sometimes push too hard .
i do get t ##ired , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i ' ve been represent ##ing these kids who have been sentence ##d to do these very har ##sh sentence ##s .
and i go to the ja ##il and i see my cl ##ient who ' s 13 and 14 , and he ' s been ce ##rt ##ified to stand trial as an adult .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a judge turn you into something that you ' re not ?
and the judge has ce ##rt ##ified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well go ##sh , if the judge can turn you into something that you ' re not , the judge must have magic power .
yeah , br ##yan , the judge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because i was up too late , wasn ' t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and i had a cl ##ient who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : " motion to try my poor , 14 - year - old black male cl ##ient like a privileg ##ed , white 75 - year - old corpor ##ate exec ##ut ##ive . "
and i put in my motion that there was pros ##ec ##ut ##or ##ial mis ##con ##duc ##t and police mis ##con ##duc ##t and jud ##ic ##ial mis ##con ##duc ##t .
there was a crazy line in there about how there ' s no condu ##ct in this county , it ' s all mis ##con ##duc ##t .
and the next morning , i wo ##ke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
and to my horr ##or , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
a couple months went by , and i had just forg ##otten all about it .
and i finally decided , oh go ##sh , i ' ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhel ##med - - overwhel ##med .
and i got in my car and i went to this court ##house .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the court ##house .
and as i was walking up the steps of this court ##house , there was an older black man who was the jan ##itor in this court ##house .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , " who are you ? "
i said , " i ' m a law ##yer . " he said , " you ' re a law ##yer ? " i said , " yes , sir . "
and this man came over to me and he hu ##g ##ged me .
and he wh ##is ##per ##ed in my ear .
he said , " i ' m so proud of you . "
and i have to tell you , it was energ ##izing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contrib ##ute to a community , to a perspective that is hope ##ful .
well i went into the court ##room .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
he said , " mr . steven ##son , did you write this crazy motion ? "
i said , " yes , sir . i did . " and we started arg ##uing .
and people started coming in because they were just out ##rage ##d .
i had written these crazy things .
and police office ##r ##s were coming in and assist ##ant pros ##ec ##ut ##ors and cle ##r ##k workers .
and before i knew it , the court ##room was filled with people angr ##y that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine ##qu ##ality .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this jan ##itor pac ##ing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this hol ##ler .
he kept pac ##ing back and forth .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the court ##room and sat down behind me , almost at coun ##sel table .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a dep ##ut ##y she ##ri ##ff who was offen ##ded that the jan ##itor had come into court .
and this dep ##ut ##y jump ##ed up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , " jim ##m ##y , what are you doing in this court ##room ? "
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that dep ##ut ##y and he looked at me and he said , " i came into this court ##room to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . "
i ' ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral ar ##c of the universe is long , but it ben ##ds toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dign ##ity .
that all of our survival is tie ##d to the survival of everyone .
that our vision ##s of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with vision ##s of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i ' ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there ' s a refer ##end ##um coming up this spring where actually there ' s going to be an effort to red ##ire ##ct some of the money we spend on the politics of pun ##ishment .
for example , here in california we ' re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen ##alt ##y in the next five years - - one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all hom ##icide cases don ' t result in arr ##est .
5 ##6 percent of all rap ##e cases don ' t result .
so there ' s an opportunity to change that .
and this refer ##end ##um would prop ##ose having those dollars go to law en ##for ##ce ##ment and safety .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
there ' s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it ' s about increased inc ##ar ##cer ##ation rates .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
well actually the violent crime rate has remain ##ed relatively stab ##le .
the great increase in mass inc ##ar ##cer ##ation in this country wasn ' t really in violent crime categ ##ories .
it was this mis ##gu ##ided war on drugs .
that ' s where the dramatic increase ##s have come in our prison population .
and we got carried away with the r ##het ##or ##ic of pun ##ishment .
and so we have three str ##ikes laws that put people in prison forever for ste ##aling a bicycle , for low - level property crime ##s , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they vict ##im ##ized .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are vict ##im ##ized by crime , not do less .
and i think our current pun ##ishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and i think that ' s the orient ##ation that we have to change .
br ##yan , you ' ve stru ##ck a massive cho ##r ##d here .
you ' re an inspiring person .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
threat ##s , in the wake of bin laden ' s death , have sp ##ike ##d .
fam ##ine in som ##al ##ia . police pe ##pper spr ##ay .
vi ##cious cart ##els . announ ##cer five : caus ##t ##ic cru ##ise lines .
soc ##iet ##al dec ##ay . 65 dead .
tsunami war ##ning . cyber - attacks .
drug war . mass destruction . tor ##na ##do .
rece ##ss ##ion . def ##ault . do ##oms ##day . egypt . sy ##ria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my god .
so those are just a few of the clip ##s i collected over the last six months - - could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
the point is that the news media prefer ##entially feed ##s us negative stories because that ' s what our minds pay attention to .
and there ' s a very good reason for that .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sl ##iver of the tempor ##al lob ##e called the amy ##g ##da ##la .
now the amy ##g ##da ##la is our early war ##ning detect ##or , our danger detect ##or .
it sorts and sc ##our ##s through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
so given a dozen news stories , we will prefer ##entially look at the negative news .
and that old newspaper saying , " if it ble ##ed ##s it leads , " is very true .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it ' s no wonder that we ' re pe ##ss ##im ##istic .
it ' s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
but perhaps that ' s not the case .
perhaps instead , of what ' s really going on .
perhaps the tremendous progress we ' ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler ##ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abund ##ance .
now i ' m not saying we don ' t have our set of problems - - climate crisis , species extinct ##ion , water and energy short ##age - - we surely do .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in adv ##ance , but ultimately we knock them down .
so let ' s look at what this last century has been to see where we ' re going .
over the last hundred years , the average human life ##sp ##an has more than double ##d , average per cap ##ita income adjust ##ed for infl ##ation around the world has trip ##led .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1 , 000 - fold .
steve pink ##er has showed us that , in fact , we ' re living during the most peace ##ful time ever in human history .
and charles kenn ##y that global liter ##acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep setting our expect ##ations higher and higher .
in fact , we rede ##fin ##e what poverty means .
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toile ##ts , refr ##iger ##ators , television , mobile phones , air condition ##ing and cars .
the wealth ##iest rob ##ber bar ##ons of the last century , the emp ##er ##ors on this planet , could have never dream ##ed of such lux ##uries .
under ##p ##inning much of this is technology , and of late , expon ##entially growing technologies .
my good friend ray kurz ##weil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jump ##s on this curve , on moore ' s law , and experiences price performance dou ##bling every 12 to 24 months .
that ' s why the cell ##phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheap ##er and a thousand times faster than a super ##comput ##er of the ' 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore ' s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
number one , how sm ##ooth it is - - through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , rece ##ss ##ion , depression and boom time .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it doesn ' t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and also , even though it ' s plot ##ted on a log curve on the left , it ' s cur ##ving up ##wards .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
and on this curve , rid ##ing on moore ' s law , are a set of extraord ##ina ##ri ##ly powerful technologies available to all of us .
cloud computing , what my friends at auto ##des ##k call infinite computing ; sensor ##s and networks ; robot ##ics ; 3d printing , which is the ability to democrat ##ize and distr ##ib ##ute personal ##ized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccine ##s and food ##s ; digital medicine ; nano ##material ##s ; and a . i .
i mean , how many of you saw the win ##ning of je ##op ##ard ##y by i ##bm ' s wa ##ts ##on ?
i mean , that was ep ##ic .
in fact , i sc ##our ##ed the head ##lines looking for the best head ##line in a newspaper i could .
and i love this : " wa ##ts ##on van ##qu ##ish ##es human opp ##onen ##ts . "
je ##op ##ard ##y ' s not an easy game .
it ' s about the nu ##ance of human language .
and imagine if you would a . i . ' s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell ##phone .
four years ago here at ted , ray kurz ##weil and i started a new university called sing ##ular ##ity university .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity ' s grand challenges .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positive ##ly the lives of a billion people within a decade .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have sound ##ed lu ##di ##c ##ro ##us .
today we can point at dozen ##s of companies that have done just that .
when i think about creating abund ##ance , it ' s not about creating a life of lux ##ury for everybody on this planet ; it ' s about creating a life of possibility .
it is about taking that which was scar ##ce and making it abund ##ant .
you see , scar ##ci ##ty is context ##ual , and technology is a resource - liber ##ating force .
let me give you an example .
so this is a story of na ##pol ##e ##on ii ##i in the mid - 18 ##00 ##s .
he ' s the du ##de on the left .
he invited over to dinner the king of s ##ia ##m .
all of na ##pol ##e ##on ' s tro ##ops were fed with sil ##ver ut ##ens ##ils , na ##pol ##e ##on himself with gold ut ##ens ##ils .
but the king of s ##ia ##m , he was fed with al ##umin ##um ut ##ens ##ils .
you see , al ##umin ##um was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat ##in ##um .
it ' s the reason that the t ##ip of the washington mon ##ument is made of al ##umin ##um .
you see , even though al ##umin ##um is 8 . 3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn ' t come as a pure metal .
it ' s all bound by oxygen and sil ##icate ##s .
but then the technology of electro ##ly ##s ##is came along and literally made al ##umin ##um so cheap that we use it with throw - away mental ##ity .
so let ' s project this analog ##y going forward .
we think about energy scar ##ci ##ty .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bath ##ed with 5 , 000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 ter ##aw ##att ##s of energy hits the earth ' s surface every 8 ##8 minutes .
it ' s not about being scar ##ce , it ' s about access ##ibility .
and there ' s good news here .
for the first time , this year the cost of solar - generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel - generated electricity in india - - 8 . 8 ru ##pe ##es versus 17 ru ##pe ##es .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun ##ny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kil ##ow ##att hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and if we have abund ##ant energy , we also have abund ##ant water .
now we talk about water wars .
do you remember when car ##l sag ##an turned the vo ##ya ##ger space ##craft back towards the earth , in 1990 after it just passed saturn ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
" a pale blue dot . "
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
yes , 9 ##7 . 5 percent is salt ##water , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
there ' s nano ##techn ##ology coming on , nano ##material ##s .
and the conversation i had with de ##an kamen this morning , one of the great di ##y innov ##ators , i ' d like to share with you - - he gave me per ##mission to do so - - his technology called sl ##ings ##ho ##t that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor ##m room refr ##iger ##ator .
it ' s able to generate a thousand liter ##s of clean drinking water a day out of any source - - salt ##water , poll ##uted water , lat ##ri ##ne - - at less than two cents a liter .
the chair ##man of coca - cola has just agree ##d to do a major test of hundreds of unit ##s of this in the developing world .
and if that pan ##s out , which i have every confidence it will , coca - cola will deploy this global ##ly to 20 ##6 countries around the planet .
this is the kind of innovation , empower ##ed by this technology , that exists today .
and we ' ve seen this in cell ##phones .
my good ##ness , we ' re going to hit 70 percent pen ##et ##ration of cell ##phones in the developing world by the end of 201 ##3 .
think about it , that a mas ##ai war ##ri ##or on a cell ##phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile comm than president reag ##an did 25 years ago .
and if they ' re on a smart ##phone on google , they ' ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
they ' re living in a world of information and communication abund ##ance that no one could have ever predict ##ed .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for - - gps , h ##d video and still images , libr ##aries of books and music , medical diagnost ##ic technology - - are now literally dem ##aterial ##izing and demon ##et ##izing into your cell ##phone .
probably the best part of it is what ' s coming down the p ##ike in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of announ ##cing with qual ##com ##m foundation something called the $ 10 million qual ##com ##m tri ##co ##r ##der x prize .
we ' re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it ' s got a . i . , you can cou ##gh on it , you can do a finger blood pr ##ick .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board - ce ##rt ##ified doctors .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur ##den and 1 . 3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device sequence ##s an r ##na or dna virus that it doesn ' t recognize , it calls the c ##d ##c and prevent ##s the pandem ##ic from happening in the first place .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abund ##ance .
i call it the rising billion .
so the white lines here are population .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educ ##ated and healthy .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
by 20 ##20 , that ' s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they consum ##e ? what will they desire ?
and rather than having economic shut ##do ##wn , we ' re about to have the biggest economic inj ##ect ##ion ever .
these people represent tens of trillion ##s of dollars inj ##ect ##ed into the global economy .
and they will get health ##ier by using the tri ##co ##r ##der , and they ' ll become better educ ##ated by using the k ##han academ ##y , and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing [ become ] more productive than ever before .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , educ ##ated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
what about giving the opp ##ress ##ed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contrib ##utions we can ' t even predict ?
the one thing i ' ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corpor ##ations and governments could only do in the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it ' s a game called fold ##it .
it came out of the university of washington in seat ##t ##le .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of am ##ino ac ##ids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and how it fold ##s dict ##ates its structure and its function ##ality .
and it ' s very important for research in medicine .
and up until now , it ' s been a super ##comput ##er problem .
and this game has been played by university professor ##s and so forth .
and it ' s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogn ##ition machine ##ry is better at fold ##ing proteins than the best computers .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fold ##er in the world , it wasn ' t an mit professor , it wasn ' t a cal ##te ##ch student , it was a person from england , from manche ##ster , a woman who , during the day , was an exec ##ut ##ive assist ##ant at a re ##hab clinic and , at night , was the world ' s best protein fold ##er .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empower ##ed as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we have the tools with this expon ##ential technology .
we have the passion of the di ##y innov ##ator .
we have the capital of the techn ##o - philanthrop ##ist .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and i think it starts with one physic ##ian , and that ' s me .
and maybe i ' ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false pres ##t ##ige to be able to do that .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let ' s begin with a bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we ' re near the end , we ' re getting close to the world series .
we all love baseball , don ' t we ?
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there ' s hundreds of them .
" money ##ball " is about to come out , and it ' s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
i ' m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
it ' s called bat ##ting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bat ##s 300 .
that means that ball ##pl ##ay ##er bat ##ted safe ##ly , hit safe ##ly three times out of 10 at bat ##s .
that means hit the ball into the out ##f ##ield , it dropped , it didn ' t get caught , and who ##ever tried to throw it to first base didn ' t get there in time and the run ##ner was safe .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 hit ##ter in major lea ##gu ##e baseball ?
good , really good , maybe an all - star .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hit ##ter ?
that ' s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safe ##ly out of every 10 .
legen ##da ##ry - - as in ted william ##s legen ##da ##ry - - the last major lea ##gu ##e baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
now let ' s take this back into my world of medicine where i ' m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i ' m going to talk to you about .
suppose you have app ##end ##icit ##is and you ' re refer ##red to a surgeon who ' s bat ##ting 400 on app ##ende ##ct ##om ##ies .
somehow this isn ' t working out , is it ?
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has block ##ages in two cor ##ona ##ry art ##erie ##s and your family doctor refer ##s that loved one to a card ##iol ##og ##ist who ' s bat ##ting 200 on ang ##iop ##la ##st ##ies .
but , but , you know what ?
she ' s doing a lot better this year . she ' s on the come ##back tra ##il .
and she ' s hit ##ting a 25 ##7 .
somehow this isn ' t working .
but i ' m going to ask you a question .
what do you think a bat ##ting average for a card ##ia ##c surgeon or a nur ##se pract ##ition ##er or an ort ##ho ##ped ##ic surgeon , an ob ##g ##yn , a param ##ed ##ic is supposed to be ?
1 , 000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physic ##ian or param ##ed ##ic is supposed to bat .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the adm ##on ##ition , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that ' s going to happen .
and that was the message that i absorb ##ed when i was in med school .
i was an obs ##ess ##ive comp ##uls ##ive student .
in high school , a class ##mat ##e once said that brian gold ##man would study for a blood test .
and so i did .
and i studied in my little gar ##ret at the nur ##ses ' res ##idence at tor ##ont ##o general hospital , not far from here .
and i memor ##ized everything .
i memor ##ized in my anatom ##y class the origin ##s and exer ##t ##ions of every muscle , every bran ##ch of every art ##ery that came off the a ##ort ##a , different ##ial diagnose ##s obs ##c ##ure and common .
i even knew the different ##ial diagn ##osis in how to class ##ify ren ##al tu ##bu ##la ##r ac ##id ##osis .
and all the while , i was am ##ass ##ing more and more knowledge .
and i did well , i graduate ##d with honor ##s , c ##um lau ##de .
and i came out of medical school with the impress ##ion that if i memor ##ized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immun ##ize me against making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr ##s . drucker .
i was a res ##ident at a teaching hospital here in tor ##ont ##o when mr ##s . drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working .
at the time i was assign ##ed to the card ##iol ##og ##y service on a card ##iol ##og ##y rot ##ation .
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a card ##iol ##og ##y cons ##ult , to see that patient in emer ##g .
and to report back to my att ##ending .
and i saw mr ##s . drucker , and she was breath ##less .
and when i listen ##ed to her , she was making a whe ##e ##zy sound .
and when i listen ##ed to her chest with a ste ##th ##osc ##ope , i could hear crack ##ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con ##gest ##ive heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fail ##s , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood back ##s up into the lung , the lung ##s fill up with blood , and that ' s why you have short ##ness of breath .
and that wasn ' t a difficult diagn ##osis to make .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
i gave her asp ##ir ##in . i gave her medic ##ations to rel ##ie ##ve the stra ##in on her heart .
i gave her medic ##ations that we call di ##ure ##t ##ics , water pill ##s , to get her to pe ##e out the access flu ##id .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and i felt really good .
and that ' s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without speaking to my att ##ending .
i didn ' t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my att ##ending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and he knew her , he would have been able to furn ##ish addition ##al information about her .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn ' t want to be a high - maint ##en ##ance res ##ident .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my att ##ending ' s patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
in sending her home , i dis ##reg ##ard ##ed a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , " gold ##man , not a good idea . don ' t do this . "
in fact , so lack ##ing in confidence was i that i actually asked the nur ##se who was looking after mr ##s . drucker , " do you think it ' s okay if she goes home ? "
and the nur ##se thought about it and said very matter - of - fact ##ly , " yeah , i think she ' ll do okay . "
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
so i sign ##ed the disc ##har ##ge papers , and an amb ##ul ##ance came , param ##ed ##ics came to take her home .
and i went back to my work on the war ##ds .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of g ##na ##wing feeling inside my sto ##ma ##ch .
but i carried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , i pack ##ed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don ' t usually do .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
and it was there that another nur ##se , not the nur ##se who was looking after mr ##s . drucker before , but another nur ##se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physic ##ians i know dre ##ad .
others in medicine dre ##ad them as well , but there ' s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fle ##et ##ingly .
the three words are : do you remember ?
" do you remember that patient you sent home ? "
the other nur ##se asked matter - of - fact ##ly .
" well she ' s back , " in just that ton ##e of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i ' d sent her home , she collapse ##d and her family called 9 ##1 ##1 and the param ##ed ##ics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
and she was bare ##ly breathing and she was blue .
and the emer ##g . staff pulled out all the stop ##s .
they gave her medic ##ations to raise her blood pressure .
they put her on a vent ##ila ##to ##r .
and i was shock ##ed and shake ##n to the core .
and i went through this rolle ##r coast ##er , because after they stabil ##ized her , she went to the intens ##ive care unit , and i hope ##d against hope that she would recover .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had irre ##vers ##ible brain damage .
and the family gather ##ed .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they res ##ign ##ed themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go - - mr ##s . drucker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was my first time to be acqu ##ain ##ted with that .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the un ##he ##alth ##y shame that exists in our culture of medicine - - where i felt alone , isol ##ated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can ' t talk about it with your colleagues .
you know that healthy kind , when you betr ##ay a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve ##al and then you get bus ##ted and then your best friend conf ##ron ##ts you and you have terrible discussion ##s , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guide ##s you and you say , i ' ll never make that mistake again .
and you make ame ##nd ##s and you never make that mistake again .
that ' s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
the un ##he ##alth ##y shame i ' m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
it ' s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what i was feeling .
and it wasn ' t because of my att ##ending ; he was a doll .
he talked to the family , and i ' m quite sure that he sm ##ooth ##ed things over and made sure that i didn ' t get su ##ed .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
why didn ' t i ask my att ##ending ? why did i send her home ?
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly but surely , it lift ##ed .
i began to feel a bit better .
and on a cloud ##y day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
and i made myself a bar ##ga ##in that if only i red ##ou ##ble my effort ##s to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
and they did .
and i went back to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later i was an att ##ending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of tor ##ont ##o , and i saw a 25 year - old man with a sor ##e thro ##at .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hur ##ry .
he kept point ##ing here .
i looked at his thro ##at , it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a presc ##ript ##ion for pen ##ic ##ill ##in and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of point ##ing to his thro ##at .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that ' s when my chief asked to speak to me quiet ##ly in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
" do you remember that patient you saw with the sor ##e thro ##at ? "
well it turns out , he didn ' t have a stre ##p thro ##at .
he had a potentially life - threaten ##ing condition called ep ##ig ##lo ##tt ##iti ##s .
you can google it , but it ' s an infe ##ction , not of the thro ##at , but of the upper air ##way , and it can actually cause the air ##way to close .
and fort ##unately he didn ' t die .
he was place ##d on intr ##aven ##ous antibiot ##ics and he recover ##ed after a few days .
and i went through the same period of shame and rec ##ri ##min ##ations and felt clean ##sed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
twice in one emergency shift , i miss ##ed app ##end ##icit ##is .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , i didn ' t send them home and i don ' t think there was any gap in their care .
one i thought had a kid ##ney stone .
i order ##ed a kid ##ney x - ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleag ##ue who was doing a reas ##ses ##s ##ment of the patient noticed some tend ##erne ##ss in the right lower quad ##ra ##nt and called the surgeon ##s .
the other one had a lot of di ##arr ##he ##a .
i order ##ed some flu ##ids to re ##hy ##dr ##ate him and asked my colleag ##ue to reas ##ses ##s him .
and he did and when he noticed some tend ##erne ##ss in the right lower quad ##ra ##nt , called the surgeon ##s .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
but each time , they were g ##na ##wing at me , eating at me .
and i ' d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b . s .
some of my do ##oz ##ies have been in the last five years .
alone , as ##ham ##ed and uns ##up ##port ##ed .
here ' s the problem : if i can ' t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can ' t find the still - small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don ' t do the same thing ?
if i were to walk into a room - - like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a co ##ckt ##ail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you ' re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colleag ##es and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i ' ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn ' t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncom ##fort ##able , somebody would crack a joke , they ' d change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my ort ##ho ##ped ##ic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i ' d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
that ' s the system that we have .
it ' s a complete den ##ial of mistakes .
it ' s a system in which there are two kinds of physic ##ians - - those who make mistakes and those who don ' t , those who can ' t handle sleep depr ##iv ##ation and those who can , those who have lou ##sy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and it ' s almost like an ide ##ological reaction , like the antib ##odies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad ##cast ##ing and journal ##ism , i ' ve made a personal study of medical mal ##pr ##act ##ice and medical error ##s to learn everything i can , from one of the first article ##s i wrote for the tor ##ont ##o star to my show " white co ##at , black art . "
and what i ' ve learned is that error ##s are absolutely u ##bi ##quit ##ous .
we work in a system where error ##s happen every day , where one in 10 medic ##ations are either the wrong medic ##ation given in hospital or at the wrong do ##sa ##ge , where hospital - acqu ##ired infe ##ctions are getting more and more num ##er ##ous , causing ha ##vo ##c and death .
in this country , as many as 24 , 000 can ##ad ##ians die of prevent ##able medical error ##s .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pe ##g ##ged it at 100 , 000 .
in both cases , these are gross under ##est ##imate ##s , because we really aren ' t fer ##ret ##ing out the problem as we should .
and here ' s the thing .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou ##bling every two or three years , we can ' t keep up with it .
sleep depr ##iv ##ation is absolutely per ##vas ##ive .
we can ' t get rid of it .
we have our cognitive bi ##ases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them mo ##ist and gar ##ru ##lo ##us and put a little bit of al ##co ##hol on their breath , and suddenly my history is la ##ced with contem ##pt .
i don ' t take the same history .
i ' m not a robot ; i don ' t do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren ' t cars ; they don ' t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
given all of that , mistakes are inevit ##able .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and wee ##d out all the error - pro ##ne health professional ##s , well there won ' t be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not want ##ing to talk about their worst cases ?
on my show , on " white co ##at , black art , " i made it a habit of saying , " here ' s my worst mistake , " i would say to everybody from param ##ed ##ics to the chief of card ##ia ##c surgery , " here ' s my worst mistake , " bl ##ah , bl ##ah , bl ##ah , bl ##ah , bl ##ah , " what about your ##s ? " and i would point the micro ##phone towards them .
and their pu ##p ##ils would di ##la ##te , they would rec ##o ##il , then they would look down and sw ##allow hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , " look , don ' t make the same mistake i did . "
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a rede ##fin ##ed medical culture .
and it starts with one physic ##ian at a time .
the rede ##fin ##ed physic ##ian is human , knows she ' s human , accept ##s it , isn ' t proud of making mistakes , but str ##ives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shares her experience with others .
she ' s support ##ive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she points out other people ' s mistakes , not in a got ##ch ##a way , but in a lo ##ving , support ##ive way so that everybody can benefit .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ack ##no ##w ##ledge ##s that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
so the system is evol ##ving to create back ##up ##s that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevit ##ably make and also fo ##sters in a lo ##ving , support ##ive way places where everybody who is observ ##ing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is reward ##ed for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we ' re reward ##ed for coming clean .
my name is brian gold ##man .
i am a rede ##fin ##ed physic ##ian .
i ' m human . i make mistakes .
i ' m sorry about that , but i str ##ive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
i still don ' t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
i ' m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and this is about shift ##ing base ##line .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and he was here , as you well know , in ' 35 .
and you ' d think he was cha ##s ##ing fin ##ches , but he wasn ' t .
he was actually collect ##ing fish .
and he described one of them as very " common . "
this was the sa ##il ##fin group ##er .
a big fisher ##y was run on it until the ' 80 ##s .
now the fish is on the i ##uc ##n red list .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gal ##ap ##ago ##s and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come to gal ##ap ##ago ##s .
we still think it is pr ##ist ##ine .
the bro ##ch ##ures still say it is unt ##ou ##ched .
so what happens here ?
the second story , also to illustr ##ate another concept , is called shift ##ing wa ##ist ##line .
because i was there in ' 7 ##1 , studying a lag ##oon in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
and i thought i could ble ##nd in .
and i got a big sun ##bur ##n , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
this was my first sun ##bur ##n .
and the lag ##oon was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few man ##gro ##ve .
and it had t ##ila ##p ##ia about 20 cent ##imeter ##s , a species of t ##ila ##p ##ia called black ##ch ##in t ##ila ##p ##ia .
and the fisher ##ies for this t ##ila ##p ##ia sustain ##ed lots of fish and they had a good time and they earn ##ed more than average in ghana .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had shr ##unk to half of their size .
they were mat ##uring at five cent ##imeter ##s .
they had been push ##ed genetic ##ally .
there were still fish ##es .
they were still kind of happy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third little story is that i was an accompl ##ice in the introdu ##ction of tra ##w ##ling in south ##e ##ast asia .
in the ' 70s - - well , beginning in the ' 60s - - europe did lots of development projects .
fish development meant imp ##osing on countries that had already 100 , 000 fisher ##s and this boat , quite ug ##ly , is called the mut ##iar ##a 4 .
and i went sa ##iling on it , and we did survey ##s throughout the southern south china sea and especially the ja ##va sea .
and what we caught , we didn ' t have words for it .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and 90 percent of our catch were spo ##ng ##es , other animals that are fix ##ed on the bottom .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the deb ##ris , the pil ##es of deb ##ris , were coral reef fish .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the dec ##k and then was throw ##n down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu ##d ##dy mess .
this is a dead tur ##t ##le .
they were not eat ##en , they were throw ##n away because they were dead .
and one time we caught a live one .
it was not dro ##wn ##ed yet .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this mountain of deb ##ris is actually collected by fisher ##s every time they go into an area that ' s never been fish ##ed .
but it ' s not document ##ed .
we transform the world , but we don ' t remember it .
we adjust our base ##line to the new level , and we don ' t rec ##all what was there .
if you general ##ize this , something like this happens .
you have on the y axis some good thing : biod ##ivers ##ity , numbers of or ##ca , the green ##ness of your country , the water supply .
and over time it changes - - it changes because people do things , or naturally .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra ##pol ##ate forward .
and the difference then , they perce ##ive as a loss .
but they don ' t perce ##ive what happened before as a loss .
you can have a success ##ion of changes .
at the end you want to sustain mis ##era ##ble left ##over ##s .
and that , to a large ext ##ent , is what we want to do now .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in pred ##atory societies , they killed animals and they didn ' t know they had done so after a few generations .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abund ##ant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
so you don ' t lose abund ##ant animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore they ' re not perce ##ived as a big loss .
over time , we concent ##rate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
they become rare ##r because we fish them .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the base ##line .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
well because they don ' t know that it was different .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will cont ##est that it was really different .
and they will cont ##est this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
for example , the an ##ecd ##ote that some present , as capt ##ain so - and - so observ ##ed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not ut ##il ##ized by fisher ##y scientists , because it ' s not " scientific . "
so you have a situation where people don ' t know the past , even though we live in liter ##ate societies , because they don ' t trust the sources of the past .
and hen ##ce , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
because with marine protected areas , we actually rec ##reat ##e the past .
we rec ##reat ##e the past that people cannot conc ##e ##ive because the base ##line has shift ##ed and is extremely low .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provide ##s , which enable ##s them to res ##et their base ##line .
how about the people who can ' t do that because they have no access - - the people in the mid ##west for example ?
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
this is a simulation of che ##sa ##pe ##ake bay .
there were gray whales in che ##sa ##pe ##ake bay a long time ago - - 500 years ago .
and you will have noticed that the hu ##es and ton ##es are like " av ##atar . "
and if you think about " av ##atar , " if you think of why people were so touch ##ed by it - - never mind the po ##ca ##ho ##nt ##as story - - why so touch ##ed by the image ##ry ?
because it ev ##oke ##s something that in a sense has been lost .
and so my rec ##ommen ##da ##t ##ion , it ' s the only one i will provide , is for came ##ron to do " av ##atar ii " underwater .
thank you very much .
in the 1980 ##s in the commun ##ist eastern germany , if you own ##ed a type ##w ##ri ##ter , you had to reg ##ister it with the government .
you had to reg ##ister a sample she ##et of text out of the type ##w ##ri ##ter .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west couldn ' t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would rest ##ric ##t freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser print ##er from any major laser print ##er manufact ##urer and print a page , that page will end up having sl ##ight yellow dots print ##ed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your print ##er .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a fu ##ss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what ' s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attack ##ers .
we have three main groups .
we have online cr ##iminal ##s .
like here , we have mr . di ##mit ##ry gol ##ub ##ov from the city of k ##ie ##v in u ##kr ##ain ##e .
and the motiv ##es of online cr ##iminal ##s are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of million ##air ##es online , multi ##mi ##ll ##ion ##air ##es , who made money with their attacks .
here ' s v ##lad ##im ##ir ts ##ast ##s ##in form tar ##t ##u in est ##on ##ia .
this is al ##fre ##d go ##n ##z ##ale ##z .
this is stephen watt .
this is b ##jor ##n sun ##di ##n .
this is mat ##the ##w anders ##on , tar ##i ##q al - da ##our and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortune ##s online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like bank ##ing tro ##ja ##ns to ste ##al money from our bank account ##s while we do online bank ##ing , or with key ##lo ##g ##gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shop ##ping from an infected computer .
the u . s . secret service , two months ago , fro ##ze the sw ##iss bank account of mr . sam ja ##in right here , and that bank account had 14 . 9 million u . s . dollars on it when it was fro ##zen .
mr . ja ##in himself is on the lo ##ose ; nobody knows where he is .
and i claim it ' s already today that it ' s more likely for any of us to become the vict ##im of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it ' s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of attack ##ers that we are watching today are not motiv ##ated by money .
they ' re motiv ##ated by something else - - motiv ##ated by protest ##s , motiv ##ated by an opinion , motiv ##ated by the laugh ##s .
groups like anonym ##ous have rise ##n up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
so those are the three main attack ##ers : cr ##iminal ##s who do it for the money , hack ##t ##iv ##ists like anonym ##ous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in dig ##ino ##t ##ar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
dig ##ino ##t ##ar is a ce ##rt ##ific ##ate authority from the net ##her ##lands - - or actually , it was .
it was running into bank ##rupt ##cy last fall because they were hack ##ed into .
somebody broke in and they hack ##ed it th ##or ##ough ##ly .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dut ##ch government represent ##atives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl ##aus ##ible that people died because of the dig ##ino ##t ##ar hack .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
well dig ##ino ##t ##ar is a c . a .
they sell ce ##rt ##ific ##ates .
what do you do with ce ##rt ##ific ##ates ?
well you need a ce ##rt ##ific ##ate if you have a website that has h ##tt ##ps , s ##sl enc ##ry ##pted services , services like g ##ma ##il .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g ##ma ##il or one of their compet ##itors , but these services are especially popular in total ##itarian states like iran , where diss ##idents use foreign services like g ##ma ##il because they know they are more trust ##wor ##th ##y than the local services and they are enc ##ry ##pted over s ##sl connections , so the local government can ' t sn ##oo ##p on their discussion ##s .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c . a .
and issue ro ##gu ##e ce ##rt ##ific ##ates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of dig ##ino ##t ##ar .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
well in egypt , the rio ##ters lo ##ote ##d the head ##qu ##arte ##r ##s of the egypt ##ian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were lo ##ot ##ing the building they found lots of papers .
among those papers , was this bin ##der ent ##it ##led " fin ##fish ##er . "
and within that bin ##der were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egypt ##ian government a set of tools for inter ##cept ##ing - - and in very large scale - - all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 28 ##0 , 000 eur ##os to the egypt ##ian government .
the company head ##qu ##arte ##r ##s are right here .
so western governments are providing total ##itarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so - called state tro ##ja ##n was found , which was a tro ##ja ##n used by german government official ##s to investig ##ate their own citizens .
if you are a susp ##ect in a cr ##iminal case , well it ' s pretty obvious , your phone will be tap ##ped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your internet connection .
they will even use tools like state tro ##ja ##n to infe ##ct your computer with a tro ##ja ##n , which enable ##s them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussion ##s , to collect your pass ##wor ##ds .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , " okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn ' t really affect me because i ' m a legal citi ##zen .
why should i worry ?
because i have nothing to hide . "
and this is an argument , which doesn ' t make sense .
priv ##acy is impl ##ied .
priv ##acy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between priv ##acy against security .
it ' s a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blind ##ly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
this may sound strange , but i ' m a big fan of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were manufact ##ured in 18 ##6 ##8 with a very simple idea : mod ##ules made of ce ##ment of a fix ##ed measure ##ment that fit together .
very quickly concrete blocks became the most - used construction unit in the world .
they enable ##d us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridge ##s , one br ##ick at a time .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 194 ##7 , lego came up with this .
it was called the automat ##ic bin ##ding br ##ick .
and in a few short years , lego br ##icks took place in every house ##hol ##d .
it ' s estim ##ated that over 400 billion br ##icks have been produced - - or 75 br ##icks for every person on the planet .
you don ' t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridge ##s , beautiful buildings .
lego made it accessible .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
mean ##wh ##ile the exact same year , at bell lab ##s the next revolution was about to be announ ##ced , the next building block .
the transist ##or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of stat ##ic br ##icks pil ##ed on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transist ##or allows you to build much larger , more complex circuit ##s , one br ##ick at a time .
but there ' s a main difference : the transist ##or was only for experts .
i personally don ' t accept this , that the building block of our time is reser ##ved for experts , so i decided to change that .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started developing little ##bit ##s .
let me show you how they work .
little ##bit ##s are electronic mod ##ules with each one specific function .
they ' re pre - engineer ##ed to be light , sound , motor ##s and sensor ##s .
and the best part about it is they sn ##ap together with magnet ##s .
so you can ' t put them the wrong way .
the br ##icks are color - code ##d .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
so all you need to do is sn ##ap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuit ##s .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
you can put a kn ##ob in between and now you ' ve made a little di ##mmer .
switch out the kn ##ob for a pu ##ls ##e mod ##ule , which is here , and now you ' ve made a little bl ##ink ##er .
add this bu ##zz ##er for some extra pun ##ch and you ' ve created a noise machine .
i ' m going to stop that .
so beyond simple play , little ##bit ##s are actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sold ##er , little ##bit ##s allow you to program using very simple intuitive gest ##ures .
so to make this bl ##ink faster or slow ##er , you would just turn this kn ##ob and basically make it pu ##ls ##e faster or slow ##er .
the idea behind little ##bit ##s is that it ' s a growing library .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready - to - use br ##ick .
lights , sounds , solar pan ##els , motor ##s - - everything should be accessible .
we ' ve been giving little ##bit ##s to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it ' s been an incredible experience .
the nice ##st thing is how they start to understand the electronic ##s around them from everyday that they don ' t learn at schools .
for example , how a night ##light works , or why an elev ##ator door stay ##s open , or how an ipod respond ##s to touch .
we ' ve also been taking little ##bit ##s to design schools .
so for example , we ' ve had designers with no experience with electronic ##s what ##so ##ever start to play with little ##bit ##s as a material .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottle ##s , we have geor ##die making . . .
a few weeks ago we took little ##bit ##s to ris ##d and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what ##so ##ever - - just card ##board , wood and paper - - and told them " make something . "
here ' s an example of a project they made , a motion - activ ##ated conf ##etti can ##on ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it ' s a lob ##ster made of play ##do ##ug ##h that ' s afraid of the dark .
to these non - engineers , little ##bit ##s became another material , electronic ##s became just another material .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
so little ##bit ##s is open - source .
you can go on the website , download all the design fil ##es , make them yourself .
we want to encourage a world of creat ##ors , of invent ##ors , of contrib ##ut ##ors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and start invent ##ing .
thank you .
